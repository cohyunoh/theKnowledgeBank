Dear Connor Oh,
Today was actually not a terrible day. Seeing as this is the first journal entry, I guess you can guess that today was when you found out how to use **templates** and the **daily notes plugin**. It is only my second day using Obsidian and I love it. I hope you are still using it or have found a better version and could import these notes somehow. (you should since markdown files are pretty universal; the files tree may be fucked though). Well this is all I can write right now. I have to get back to doing my HON-105 homework and start making my bio notes in obsidian, should be a good way to take notes.
Sincerely,
Yourself
