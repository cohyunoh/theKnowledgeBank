Dear Connor Oh,
Today was quite productive. There is definitely a lot more notes to be taken, but eventually, it will be done and we should begin studying this weekend. We will crush this next BIO test. It will all work out. Just take it easy, take it slow, and get some sleep right now. It's 1:50AM. You need some sleep. Good night sweet prince.
Sincerely,
 You
