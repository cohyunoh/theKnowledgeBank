# The Platonic Academy of Florence
- Florence has always been a town of merchants and craftsmen where art, literature, and religious devotion flourished.
- Their *vernacular language* allowed for intelligent and artistic writings.
	- **Dante** alone was proof enough of this.
- The period between Dante and **Ficino** was dominated by civic humanism leading great writings by *Boccaccio, Salutati, Bruni, Marsuppini, and Alberti.*
	- It was a *literary culture*
- The arrival of **Johannes Argyropulus** marked the period when a university was needed that reflected this new era of humanistic writings.
- The **Platonic Academy** was made by Masilio Ficino and it was due in part to Argyropulus wanting to educate his son to be like the *humanist writers he adored so much*.
- The university *strayed away from the secular teachings of common universities at the time* (aka **Scholasticism**).
- How the Platonic Academy played a role in developing European thought:
	- *Fashion*: made academia cool
	- *Improving the Secular Gap*: Tried to bridge the gap between science and religion better than scholasticism did (more reliant on science).
- The person behind it all: Ficino
	- Was very bright (learned **Aristotelian physics** and got his medical degree).
	- Translated Plato (why its called *Platonic*)
	- Wrote *Platonic Theology* (his philosophical work)
- The academy was more of a circle around Ficino so he can have conversations like Plato and Socrates (*bootleg Socratic circle*).
- He surrounded himself with intellectuals and those were the people admitted in.
- Some topics discussed:
	- **Contemplation**: a direct spiritual experience from which Ficino refers to everywhere in his writings.
	- **Platonic Love**: a spiritual bond between two persons who both participate in the *contemplative life*
	- **The History of Human Thought**: Religious thoughts based on holy scripture. Platonic thought based on reason and philosophy (*truths*).
