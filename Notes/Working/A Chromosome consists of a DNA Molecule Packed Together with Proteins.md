# A Chromosome consists of a DNA Molecule Packed Together with Proteins
---
- The main component of the [[Genome|genome]] in most **bacteria** is a *double-stranded, circular DNA molecule that is associated with specific proteins*.
- A **bacterial chromosome** differs from a [[Eukaryotes|eukaryotic chromosome]] in that a eukaryotic chromosome *consists of a single linear DNA molecule* associated with a large number of proteins.
- **Bacterium** has highly condensed, **"super-coiled"**, [[Chromosomes|chromosomes]] due to it not having a nucleus and *instead just having a dense area of DNA* called the **nucleoid**.
- In [[Eukaryotes|eukaryotic cells]], DNA is *precisely combined with a large amount of protein*, making a complex known as [[Chromatin|chromatin]].
	- The *less compacted, more dispersed* [[Interphase|interphase]] [[Chromatin|chromatin]] is called [[Euchromatin|euchromatin]] (“**true chromatin**”) to distinguish it from the *more compacted, denser-appearing* [[Heterochromatin|heterochromatin]]
