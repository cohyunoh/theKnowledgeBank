# A program of differential gene expression leads to the different cell types in a multicellular organism

## A Genetic Program for Embryonic Development
- When looking at a **frog zygote** and **the tadpole it becomes**, they look *completely different*
	- This transformation is due in part to *three interrelated processes*:
		- [[Cell Division]]
		- [[Cell Differentiation]]
		- [[Morphogenesis]]

### From Fertilized Egg to Animal: What a Difference Four Days Makes
![[Pasted image 20211208153401.png]]

---
- *All three processes* are rooted in cellular behavior
	- [[Morphogenesis]] can be **traced back to changes in the shape, motility, and other characteristics of the cells that make up various regions of the embryo**
	- [[differential gene expression|Differential gene expression]] results from **the genes being regulated differently in each cell type**
- *Materials placed into the egg by maternal cells* set up a sequential program of ==gene regulatio== that is **carried out as embryonic cells divide**, and this program coordinates [[Cell Differentiation|cell differentiation]] during embryonic development
## Cytoplasmic Determinants and Inductive Signals
- The *specific genes expressed in any particular cell* of a developing organism **determines its path and its uniqueness**
- *Two sources of information* **"tell" a cell which genes to express at any given time** during embryonic development
	-  The ==egg's [[Cytoplasm|cytoplasm]]==
		- Contains both [[RNA]] and [[Proteins|proteins]] encoded by the mother's [[DNA]]
		- When **unfertilized**, *[[mRNAs]], [[Proteins|proteins]], and other substances* are **distributed unevenly**, which has a profound impact on the ==development of future embryo==
		- [[Cytoplasmic determinants]] only **influence the course of early embryo development**
	- The ==environment around the egg==
		- External signals
		- Has to do with [[induction]]

## Sequential Regulation of Gene Expression During Cellular Differentiation
- [[Determination]] was coined before biologists knew much about the *molecular changes occurring in embryos*
- Now it is understood in terms of **molecular changes that result in observable [[Cell Differentiation|cell differentiation]]**, marked by the *expression of genes for tissue-specific proteins*
- Signs of [[Determination|determination]]:
	- Appearance of [[mRNA]]s for *tissue-specific proteins* altered
	- [[Cell Differentiation|Differentiation]] is observable under a microscope
- In a *fully differentiated cell*, [[Transcription|transcription]] remains the **principal regulatory point** for *maintaining appropriate gene expression*.
- **Differentiated cells are specialists at making tissue-specific proteins**
- *Muscle cells develop from embryonic precursor cells* that have the potential to **develop into a number of cell types**, but ==particular conditions commit them to becoming muscle cells==
	- Is the result of **one or more of master regulatory genes** whose protein products *commit the cells to becoming skeletal muscle genes*
	- *myoD* is one of these **master regulatory genes**
		- ==MyoD protein== changes fat cells and liver cells into muscle cells
			- This transformation only happens with a few cells due to perhaps **the cells having a particular combination** of regulatory proteins

## Pattern Formation: Setting Up the Body Plan
### Introduction
- *Cytoplasmic determinants* and *[[induction|inductive signals]]* both **contribute to spatially organizing the tissues and organs of an organism in their characteristic places**
	- This is [[pattern formation]]
- This begins in the early embryo, **when the major axes of an animal are established**
	- The relative positions of the *head and tail*, *right and left* *sides*, and *back and front* — the three major axes — are set up **before organs appear** for ==bilaterally symmetrical animals==
	- The [[positional information]] are provided by *cytoplasmic determinants* and *[[induction|inductive signals]]*
### The *Life Cycle* of Drosophila
- *Fruit flies and other arthropods* have a **modular construction**, an ordered series of segments
	- Segments make up the bodies *three major parts*:
		- **head**
		- **thorax** (*mid-body from which the legs and wings extend from*)
		- **abdomen**
- Drosophila has an **anterior-posterior** (*head-to-tail*) axis, a **dorsal-ventral** (*back-to-belly*) axis, and a *right-left axis*.

### Genetic Analysis of Early Development
- Edward B. Lewis studied the **embryonic development of Drosophila**
	- Studied **bizarre mutant flies** with developmental defects that led to *extra wings or legs in the wrong place*
	- He *located these mutations* on the [[Genetic Map|genetic map]] and **connected these defects to specific genes**
	- These genes were [[homoeotic genes]]

#### Abnormal Pattern Formation in Drosophila
![[Pasted image 20211208165443.png]]

---
- Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard and Eric Wieschaus set out to identify *all the genes that affect segment formation in Drosophila*
	- The project was daunting for **three reasons**
		- 14,000 known Drosophila genes
		- [[Mutations]] affecting a process as fundamental as **segmentation** would be [[embryonic lethals]]
		- ==Cytoplasmic determinants== in the egg were known to play a role in *axis formation*, so they would need to **study the mother's genes as well as the embryo's genes**
- Began their *search for segmentation genes* by **exposing flies to mutagenic agents** and **scanning their dead embryos or larvae with abnormal segmentation or other defects**
	- Using this technique, they identified 1,200 genes *essential for normal segmentation patterns*
## Axis Establishment
### Introduction
- Now lets get into studying the mother's effect on these segmentation genes
- A gene classified as a [[maternal effect gene]] is used a lot here
### Biocid: A Morphogen That Determines Head Structures
- ==Bicoid== is a gene where if a mother has *two mutant bicoid alleles*, the embryo will lack the front half of its body and have **two tails, one on either end.**
	- This [[Phenotypes|phenotype]] suggested that the *product of the mother's bicoid gene* is essential for **setting up the anterior end of the fly** and **might be concentrated at the future anterior end of the embryo**
- This hypothesis is an example of the *morphogen gradient hypothesis* in which **gradients of substances** called [[morphogens]] **establish an embryo's axes and other features of its form**
