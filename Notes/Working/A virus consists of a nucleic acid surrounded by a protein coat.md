# A virus consists of a nucleic acid surrounded by a protein coat

## The Discovery of Viruses
- Researchers discovered viruses in the late 1800s by studying a plant disease, tobacco mosaic disease.
- *Could not find the infectious microorganism* and instead theorized that this disease could be the result of **unusually small bacteria that are invisible under the microscope**
	- This was later disproved as *a test put infectious sap through a filter to get the bacteria and the sap was still infectious*
	- It does *this not due to its small size*, but due to a **[[Viruses|virus]]'s ability to replicate**

## Structure of Viruses
### Viral Genomes
- The [[Genome|genome]] may be **single- or double-stranded** [[DNA]] or [[RNA]].
- A [[Viruses|virus]] is called a **DNA virus** or an **RNA virus** based on the kind of [[Nucleic Acids|nucleic acid]] that *makes up the [[Genome|genome]]*
- The smallest viruses have only **three genes in their genome**
- The biggest viruses can have **several hundred to 2,000 genes**
### Capsids and Envelopes
-  A [[Viruses|virus]] is a **small nucleic acid genome** *enclosed in a protein [[capsid]]* and sometimes a membranous [[viral envelope]]. 
- [[capsid|Capsids]] are **built from a large number of protein subunits** called *capsomeres*

- The main reason for a [[viral envelope]] is that some [[Viruses|viruses]] have **accessory structures** that *help them infect their hosts*
	- Influenza viruses
	- Can also contain *proteins and glycoproteins of viral origin*
- Many of the most complex [[capsid|capsids]] are *found among the viruses that infect bacteria*, called [[phages|bacteriophages]]
	- The first [[phages]] included **seven that infect E. coli**
		- Named T1, T2, and so on
		- The three "*T-even*" phages were **similar in structure**
