# Alterations of Chromosome Number or Structure Cause Some Genetic Disorders
---
- **Large-scale** chromosomal changes can also affect an organism's [[Phenotypes|phenotype]].
	- **Physical and chemical disturbances**, as well as errors during [[Meiosis|meiosis]], can *damage chromosomes in major ways or alter their number in a cell*.
	- Can lead to **spontaneous abortion (miscarriage)** of a fetus.
	- **Individuals with these genetic defects** commonly *exhibit various developmental defects*.
	- Plants tolerate such genetic defects better than animals do.
## Abnormal Chromosome Number
- There is an occasional mishap when the **meiotic spindle** *distributes chromosomes to daughter cells*, called a [[Nondisjunction|nondisjunction]], in which the members of a pair of [[Homologs|homologs]] *do not move apart properly during* [[Meiosis I|meiosis I]] or [[Sister Chromatids|sister chromatids]]*fail to separate during* [[Meiosis II|meiosis II]].

- If either of the **aberrant** [[Gametes|gametes]] *unites with a normal one* at [[Fertilization|fertilization]], the [[Zygote|zygote]] will also *have an abnormal number of a particular chromosome*, a condition known as [[Aneuploidy|aneuploidy]].
	- The [[Aneuploidy|aneiploid]] [[Zygote|zygote]] is can be [[Monosomic|monosomic]].
	- It can also be [[Trisomic|trisomic]].
	- [[Mitosis]] will subsequently *transmit the anomaly to all* **embryonic cells**.
- Some organisms have **more than two complete chromosome sets in all** [[Somatic Cells|somatic cells]].
	- The general term for this *chromosomal alteration* is [[Polyploidy|polyploidy]].
	- Fairly common in plant kingdom.
## Alterations of Chromosome Structure
- Four types of changes in **chromosome structure** as a result of [[Meiosis|meiosis]] errors or *damaging agents*:
	- [[Deletion]]
	- [[Duplication]]
	- [[Inversion]]
	- [[Translocation]]

---
- [[Deletion|Deletions]] and [[Duplication|duplications]] are especially likely to occur during [[Meiosis|meiosis]].
	- In [[Crossing Over|crossing over]], **nonsister chromatids** sometimes *exchange unequal-sized segments of DNA*.
## Human Conditions Due to Chromosomal Conditions
- [[Down Syndrome]]
- [[Aneuploidy of Sex Chromosomes]]
## Disorders Caused by Structurally Altered Chromosomes
- **Cri Du Chat**
	- [[Deletion]] in chromosome 5.
	- Child has a **small head** with *unusual facial features*, *severe intellectual disabilities*, and *cry that sounds like a cat meow*.
- **Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia**
	- [[Translocation|Reciprocal translocation]] happens during [[Mitosis|mitosis]] of cells that are *precursors to white blood cells*.
	- The **exchange of a large portion of chromosome 22** with a **small fragment from a tip of chromosome 9** produces a *much shortened, easily recognized chromosome 22*, called the *Philadelphia chromosome*. 
	- Such an exchange causes cancer by creating a **new “fused” gene** that leads to *uncontrolled cell cycle progression*.
