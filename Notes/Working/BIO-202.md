# The Cell Cycle
---
## Most Cell Division Results in Identical Daughter Cells
- **Unicellular** organisms reproduce by themselves via  [[Cell Division]].
- **Multcellular** organisms rely on cell division to *grow, repair, and develop* as soon as they are a fertilized egg.
- The [[Genome]] of a cell, or its **genetic material** ([[DNA]]), is split up like [[Horcruxes]] among [[Chromosomes]].
- Each [[Eukaryotic]] chromosome consists of one DNA molecule associated with many [[Proteins]] and the combination of the complex of DNA and associated proteins is called  [[Chromatin]].
- Chromatin exists in *different states of [[Condensation]]* at different times.
- In animals, [[Gametes]] have *one* set of chromosomes while [[Somatic Cells]] have *two*.
- Before cells go through cell division, they *replicate* their genetic material. The result is two **daughter cells** that each have a copy of the DNA.
- When the genetic material replicates, the chromosomes are *duplicated*
	- Each duplicated chromosome consists of two identical [[Sister Chromatids]] joined together at the center, *lengthwise*, at the **constricted region** called the [[Centromere]].
- When the *daughter cells are formed*, the **cohesion** between the two **sister chromatids** is broken and each chromatid *becomes a chromosome* for one of the daughter cells.
- **Eurkaryotic cell division** consists of [[Mitosis]](*division of the [[Nucleus]]*) and [[Cytokinesis]](*division of the [[Cytoplasm]]*).
## The Mitotic Phase Alternates With Interphase in the Cell Cycle
- [[Cell Division]] is part of the [[Cell Cycle]](*an ordered sequence of events in the life of a cell*).
- In the [[Cell Cycle]], when the cell is *not dividing*, not in [[Mitosis]], then it is in [[Interphase]].
	- **Interphase** is made up of *three* subphases: [[G1 Phase]] | [[S Phase]] |  [[G2 Phase]]
	-  The **Mitotic Phase** is made up of: [[Mitosis]] | [[Cytokinesis]]

- The [[Mitotic Spindle]], made up of microtubules, controls how the chromosomes move during [[Mitosis]].
	- In animal cells, the **mitotic spindle**  comes from the [[Centrosomes]]. This includes *spindle microtubules and asters*.
	- Some of the spindles attach to the [[Kinetichores]] of chromosomes and move the the chromosomes
