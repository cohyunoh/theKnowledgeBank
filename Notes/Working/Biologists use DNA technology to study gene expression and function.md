## Analyzing Gene Expression
- Biologists driven to understand the *assorted cell types of a multicellular organism, cancer cells, or the developing tissues of an embryo* first try to **discover which genes are expressed by the cells of interest**
### Studying the Expression of Single Genes
- We can *detect the [[mRNA]] in an embryonic sample* using **[[nucleic acid hybridization]] with molecules of complementary sequence to the [[mRNA]] we want to follow**
- Using our cloned gene *as a template*, we can synthesize a [[nucleic acid probe]]
- Example:
	- if the part of the sequence on the [[mRNA]] were

	- the synthesized single-stranded DNA probe:
		- ![[Pasted image 20211211205546.png]]
- Each probe is **labeled during synthesis with a fluorescent tag** so we can *follow it*
	- This is useful for [[in situ hybridization]]
- Other *[[mRNA]] detection techniques* may be preferable for **comparing the amounts of a specific [[mRNA]] in several samples at the same time**
	- One method is [[RT-PCR|reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)]]
		- It creates [[CDNA|complementray DNA (cDNA)]] after [[reverse transcriptase]] step

#### Making complementary DNA (cDNA) from eukaryotic genes

- Next is the [[PCR]] is step
	- While the traditional way could be used, to get more accurate results, we need to take more **quantitative data**
	- This is where *quantitative [[RT-PCR]] (qRT-PCR)* comes into play where it can **detect light and measure the PCR product**, thus *avoiding [[gel electrophoresis]]*
### Studying the Expression of Interacting Groups of Genes
- A *systems approach* is used to study how a **group of genes** works together to ==produce and maintain a functioning organism==
- This is done by using today's *rapid, inexpensive* [[DNA sequencing|DNA-sequencing methods]] to simply **sequence the [[cDNA]] from different tissue or embryo samples**
	- The method is called [[RNA-seq|RNA sequencing]], even though it is the [[cDNA]] that is being sequenced

---
#### Use of RNA sequencing (RNS-seq) to analyze expression of many genes
![[Pasted image 20211211224910.png]]
- [[mRNA]] samples are **isolated**, **cut into shorter, similar sized fragments**, and **converted into [[cDNA]]s**
- These are sequenced and a computer program reassembles them

---
- [[RNA-seq]] is a powerful technique:
	- Not based on **hybridization** with a *labeled probe*
	- Can measure levels of expression over a very wide range
	- Careful analysis provides provides a wealth of information about expression of a particular gene
		- Still needs confirmation from [[RT-PCR]]
- An older method is called [[DNA microarray assays]], is less powerful than [[RNA-seq]] but used for like ==fetal testing==
## Determining Gene Function
### Editing Genes and Genomes
- Longed for techniques for altering the [[DNA is the Genetic Material|genetic material]] in predictable ways
- [[in vitro mutagenesis]] is one method
- [[CRISPR-Cas9 system]] very useful at **knocking out a given gene in order to study what that gene does**
	- Also being used to stop insects from being able to spread diseases
### Other Methods for Studying Gene Function
- Another method for **silencing expression** of *selected genes* doesn't alter the [[Genome|genome]]; instead, it exploits the phenomenon of [[RNAi]]
	- A lot faster than [[CRISPR-Cas9 system]] but is only a temporary **reduction of gene expression**
- This knocking out of genes is *not that ethical for humans* an alternative approach is to analyze the [[Genome|genomes]] of **large numbers of people with a certain [[Phenotypes|phenotypic]] condition or disease and then those without the condition**
	- These studies are called [[genome-wide association studies]]
- ==Single base-pair variations== in the [[Genome|genomes]] of the human population are **among the most useful genetic markers**
	- This phenomenon is called [[SNP|single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)]]
