# Cancer results from genetic changes that affect cell cycle control
---
## Types of Genes Associated with Cancer
- The genes that *normally regulate cell growth and division* during the cell cycle include **genes for [[Growth Factors|growth factors]], their receptors, and the intracellular molecules or signaling pathways**
	- [[Mutations]] that alter any of these genes in [[Somatic Cells|somatic cells]] can **lead to cancer**
- The agent of such change can be **random spontaneous mutation** or **environmental influences**
- Cancer research uncovered **cancer-causing genes** called [[oncogenes]] in *certain types of viruses*
	- The *normal versions of the genes*, the [[proto-oncogenes]], **code for proteins that stimulate normal cell growth and division**

### Genetic changes that can turn proto-oncogenes into oncogenes
![[Pasted image 20211208174949.png]]
- Reasons [[proto-oncogenes]] turn into [[oncogenes]]:
	- **Epigenetic changes**
		- *Can lead to abnormal chromatin condensation in a cell which is often found in tumor cells*
	- [[Translocation]] or **transposition**
		- *If a translocated [[proto-oncogenes|proto-oncogene]] ends up near an especially active [[Promoter|promoter]] (or other [[control elements|control element]]), its [[Transcription|transcription]] may increase, making it an [[oncogenes|oncogene]]*
	- **Gene amplification**
		- *Increases the number of copies of the [[proto-oncogenes|proto-oncogene]] n the cell through repeated gene duplication*
	- **Point mutation within a [[control elements|control element]]**
		- *Can increase the [[proto-oncogenes|proto-oncogene's]] expression*
	- **Point mutation within the gene**
		- *Can change the gene's product to a protein that is more active or more resistant to degradation than the normal protein*
