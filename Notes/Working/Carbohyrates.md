# Carbohydrates
---
- **Perfect name**: made of [[Carbon|carbon]] (*"carbo-"*) and [[H2O|water]](*"-hydrates"*).
	- **Carbphydrate** formulas usually have this general formula: $C_n H_{2n} O_n$
	- "Hydrate of Carbon": $C_n (H_2 O)_n$
- [[Glucose]] formula
	- *$CO_2 + H_2O → C_6 H_{12} O_6 + O_2$*
	- **$C_6 H_{12} O_6$** → [[Glucose]]
- Simple carbohydrates are called **saccharides**.
	- Comes from Greek word for *sugar*.

## Type of Monosaccharides
- *Depends on ...*
	- the **number of carbons**.
	- Whether the **open chain form** contains an [[Aldehydes|aldehyde]] or [[Ketone|ketone]] functionality.
	-  ![[Pasted image 20211114194537.png]]
- [[Aldopentases]], [[Aldohexases|aldohexases]], and [[Ketohexases|ketohexases]] *exist in* [[Cyclic|cyclic]] and [[Acyclic|acyclic]] **forms**.

## Glucose in Depth
- [[Glucose]] (or **glucopyranose**) is an example of a [[Monosaccaride|monosaccaride]].
	- ![[Pasted image 20211114204303.png]]
	- Exists as the **open chain** and the **cyclic** [[Hemiacetals|hemiacetal]].
- Question:
	- ![[Pasted image 20211114204522.png]]
	- Answer:
		- They are [[Diastereomer|diastereomers]].
		- They are more specifically **epimers** since they only differ at one point of [[Chirality|chirality]].
		- It is more specifically **anomer** since they are a part of a [[Hemiaceta|hemiacetal]].
		- The carbon at which there is a *change of chirality* is called the **anomeric carbon (hemiacetal carbon)**.
		- *How do these two anomers interconvert?*
			- [[Mutarotation]]
			- ![[Pasted image 20211114205420.png]]
				- The percentages of how much of each respective compound is present
			- With **ring** drawn in "*standard orientation*" when the $CH_2 OH$ group (*primary hydroxyl*) is "up" the **cyclic form** is designated as a "**D sugar**". (*"down"=L*)
			- The **alpha and beta nomenclature** is determined by the *relative orientation of the $CH_2 OH$* and the *anomeric OH* .
				- trans = alpha
				- cis = beta
- Simpler way to draw glucose with all of its *stereochemical information* present?
	- [[Fischer Projection]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20211114211218.png]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20211114211239.png]] 
	- Go from *fischer projection to regular*, keep track of what centers are [[R/S Chiral Centers|R and what are S]].
		- ![[Pasted image 20211114211639.png]]
- How can we convert Fischer Projections into the cyclic structures?
	1. Number the carbons
	2. Draw the **ring structure** containing carbons *1* to the *penultimate and its oxygen*
	3. Determine *whether the sugar is D or L*.
		- **Penultimate on right** = *D*
		- **Penultimate on left** = *L*
	4. If **D sugar**, the last carbon ($CH_2OH$) will be "up".
	5. If **L sugar**, the last carbon ($CH_2OH$) will be "down".
	6. The **anomeric OH** (on carbon 1) can be *either up or down*.
	7. Place remaining *OH groups* on the ring in the following fashion
		- Right - down
		- Left - up
