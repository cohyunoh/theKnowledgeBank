# Cell Cycle Control System
---
A *cyclically operating set of molecules* in the [[Eukaryotes|eukaryotic cell]] that both *triggers and coordinates* **key events in the cell**.

It has been compared to the *control device of a washing machine*:
- Like the washer's **timing device** , the *cell cycle control system* proceeds on its own, according to a **built-in clock**.
- A washer's cycle is subject to both *internal adjustments* (such as the sensor that detects when the tub is filled with water) and *external adjustments*(such as starting/stopping the machine), and the **[[Cell Cycle|cell cycle]]** also has [[Checkpoints|checkpoints]] that *regulate it via internal and external signals*.
