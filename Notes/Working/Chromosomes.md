# Chromosomes
---
**Chromosomes** contain the *genetic material* and *reside in the [[Nucleus|nucleus]]*.

[[DNA]] is organized into these **chromosomes** which can be best described as *discrete units*.

![[DNA#^47bc02]]

Each one also is associated with *many proteins*, including small basic [[Proteins|proteins]] called **histones**.

Some of the [[Proteins|proteins]] help coil the DNA molecule of each chromosome, *reducing its length* and allowing it to fit in the [[Nucleus|nucleus]].
	
**Chromosomes** are *not distinguishable* when the cell is not going through [[Cell Division|cell division]], but when the cell is dividing, the chromosomes *form loops and coils* , [[Condensation (Chromatin)|condensing]] and becoming *thick enough to be distinguished*. That is why when we see images, we really are seeing the replicated chromosome in the form of two [[Sister Chromatids|sister chromatids]].

Each [[Eukaryotes|eukaryotic]] species has a characteristic number of chromosomes:

- Human cell has **46 chromosomes** in its [[Nucleus|nucleus]].

Each chromosome has a [[Centromeres|centromere]] and *two arms*. It is only the **one strand you see in the beginning of [[Chromosomes#^ed444e|this figure]]**.
