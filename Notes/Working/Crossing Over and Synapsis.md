# Crossing Over and Synapsis
---
After [[Interphase|interphase]], the [[Chromosomes|chromosomes]] have been **duplicated** and the [[Sister Chromatids|sister chromatids]] are held together by **cohesins**.

Early in [[Prophase I|prophase I]], the **two members of a homologous pair** *associate loosely* along their length.

Each gene on one [[Homologs|homolog]] is *aligned precisely* with the **corresponding [[Alleles|allele]]** of that gene on the other [[Homologs|homolog]].

The [[DNA]] of **two nonsister chromatids** - *one maternal and one paternal* - is broken by **specific proteins** at precisely matching points. 

Next,  the formation of a *zipper-like structure* called the [[Synaptonemal Complex|synaptonemal complex]] holds one [[Homologs|homolog]] to the other.

During this association, called [[Synapsis|synapsis]], the [[DNA]] breaks are closed up so that each broken end is joined to the corresponding segment of the *nonsister chromatid*.

These points where **crossing over** has just occurred *become visible* as [[Chiasmata|chiasmata]] after the [[Synaptonemal Complex|synaptonemal complex]] **disassembles** and the [[Homologs|homologs]] move *slightly apart from each other*.
