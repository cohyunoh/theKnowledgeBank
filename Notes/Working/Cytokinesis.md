# Cytokinesis

This part of the **Mitotic Phase** generally begins in either [[Anaphase | anaphase]] or [[Telophase|telophase]].

This is where the [[Mitotic Spindle|spindle]] **disassembles** by *depolymerization of microtubules*.

It occurs by a process known as [[Cleavage|cleavage]] where the first sign of it is a **cleavage furrow** which is a *shallow groove in the cell surface near the old [[Metaphase Plate|metaphase plate]]*.

On the **cytoplasmic side** of the furrow, a [[Contractile Ring|contractile ring]], made up of [[Actin|actin]] microfilaments and [[Myosins|myosin]] molecules which interact with each other to *make the ring contract*.

Think of it like *pulling a drawstring*
