# DNA Sequencing and DNA cloning are valuable tools for genetic engineering and biological inquiry
## Introduction
- [[Nucleic acid hybridization]], the **base pairing of one strand of a [[Nucleic Acids|nucleic acid]] to the complementary sequence** on a strand *from another nucleic acid molecule*, is widely used in [[DNA technology]].
- [[Nucleic acid hybridization]] sets the foundation for **every technique** in [[genetic engineering]]
## DNA Sequencing
- [[DNA sequencing]] can be **carried out using the dideoxy sequencing method** in *automated sequencing machines*.
	- This was the **first generation**
- **Fast and inexpensive next-generation** (high-throughput) **techniques** for sequencing DNA are based on *sequencing by synthesis*: 
	- [[DNA Polymerases|DNA polymerase]] is used to synthesize a *stretch of DNA* using a ==single-stranded template==, and **the order in which nucleotides are added reveals the sequence**. 
	- Third-generation sequencing methods, including ==nanopore technology==, **sequence long DNA molecules** *one at a time*.
		- The technique is to *move a single stand of a DNA molecule through a very small pore (==nanopore==) in a membrane* and then **identify all the bases one by one by the distinct way each interrupts an electrical current**
## Making Multiple Copies of a Gene or Other DNA Segment
- [[Gene cloning]] (or [[DNA cloning]]) *produces multiple copies of a gene* (or DNA segment) that can be used to **manipulate and analyze DNA and to produce useful new products or organisms with beneficial traits**.
	- Good for isolating genes
- Bacteria is used most commonly when trying to clone pieces of DNA because they have [[plasmids]]
- They isolate [[plasmids]] and **alter them** by [[genetic engineering]], resulting in a [[recombinant DNA molecule]]
- The [[plasmids]] act as [[cloning vector]]s
- [[Gene cloning]] is useful for **amplifying** a gene to **produce a protein product from it**

## Using Restriction Enzymes to Make a Recombinant DNA Plasmid
- In genetic engineering, bacterial [[restriction enzymes]] are used to **cut DNA molecules within short, specific nucleotide sequences ([[restriction sites]])**, yielding a set of *double-stranded [[restriction fragments]] with single-stranded sticky ends*

- The [[sticky ends]] on [[restriction fragments]] from **one DNA source can base-pair with complementary sticky ends on fragments from other DNA molecules**. 
- *Sealing the base-paired fragments* with [[DNA ligase]] produces [[recombinant DNA molecules]].
- [[restriction fragments|DNA restriction fragments]] of *different lengths* can **be separated** by [[gel electrophoresis]].
## Amplifying DNA: The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Its Use in DNA Cloning
- The [[PCR|polymerase chain reaction (PCR)]] can **amplify (produce many copies of) a specific target segment of DNA**, using primers that bracket the desired sequence and a heat-resistant [[DNA polymerase]].
- A **three step cycle** will cause a *chain reaction that produces an exponentially growing population of identical DNA molecules*
	- During each cycle:
		1. Reaction mixture is *heated to high temperatures* to **denature (separate) the strands of the double-stranded DNA**
		2. It is then *cooled* to allow **annealing (hydrogen bonding) of** ==short, single-stranded DNA primers== that are *complementary to sequences on opposite strands at each end of the target sequence*
		3. A special [[DNA polymerases|DNA polymerase]] extends the primers in the **5' -> 3' direction** and does not denature the enzyme
	- Cycle repeats like *30-40 times*
- [[PCR]] is **speedy and very specific** due to the *its ability to only need a minuscule amount of DNA* and *primers used for each [[PCR]] amplification*, respectively

## Expressing Cloned Eukaryotic Genes
 - ==Recombinant plasmids== are **returned to host cells**, each of which divides to form *a clone of cells*.
### Bacterial Expression Systems
- To allow for a *cloned eukaryotic gene to function in bacterial host cells*, an [[expression vector]] is needed
### Eukaryotic DNA Cloning and Expression Systems
-  Using eukaryotic cells like **yeast** avoids the previously mentioned issue
	- Yeast has [[plasmids]]
- *Eukaryotic host cells* are advantageous due to **how many eukaryotic proteins will not function unless modified** after [[translation]] from the [[Endoplasmic Reticulum|ER]] and the [[Golgi Apparatus]]
- [[Electroporation]]
