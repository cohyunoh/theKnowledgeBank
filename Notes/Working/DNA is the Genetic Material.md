# DNA is the Genetic Material
---
## Introduction
- Once [[Genes|genes]] were proven to *exist* as a part of [[Chromosomes|chromosomes]], the debate about whether [[DNA]] or [[Proteins|proteins]] were the **genetic material** arose.
	- Studies of **bacteria and viruses** is what led to the discovery of [[DNA]] as the genetic material despite [[Proteins|proteins]] looking like a *more suitable candidate*.

## The Search for the Genetic Material
### Frederick Griffith
- **Frederick Griffith**, a British medical officer, was trying to develop a *vaccine for pneumonia*, studying ==[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]==. 
	- He had **two varieties**, one [[Pathogenic|pathogenic]] and one [[Nonpathogenic|nonpathogenic]].
	- When he killed the [[Pathogenic|pathogenic bateria]] with **heat**, and then *mixed the remains* with the [[Nonpathogenic|nonpathogenic bacteria]], some of the living cells became [[Pathogenic|pathogenic]].
	- This [[Pathogenic|pathogenic trait]] was passed down to the **transformed living cell's descendants**.
	- Phenomenon is called [[Transformation|transformation]].

### Evidence that Viral DNA can Program Cells
- Studies of **viruses infecting bacteria** also supported the *DNA is the genetic material* theory.
	- These bacteria are called **bacteriophages** (*bacteria-eaters*)
- [[Viruses]] are much simpler than cells.
	- To produce more [[Viruses|viruses]], a **virus** must *infect a cell* and *take over the cell's metabolic machinery*.
- **Phages** have been widely used as tools by *researchers in molecular genetics*.
	- When **studying the infection of** [[E. Coli|E. coli]], they figured out that [[Viruses|viruses]] *take over host cells* and *turn them into a virus factory*, they questioned what allowed it to [[Transformation|transform]] it.

- Found out that the **phage DNA** enters the cell, but not the **phage protein**

### Additional Evidence that DNA is the Genetic Material
- Additional study done by **Erwin Chargraff**
- [[DNA]] was known to be a **polymer of nucleotides**, each having three components:
	- A **nitrogenous** (*nitrogen-containing*) **base**
	- A **pentose sugar** called *deoxyribose*
	- A **phosphate group**
- The base can be:
	- **Adenine (A)**
	- **Thymine (T)**
	- **Guanine (G)**
	- **Cytosine (C)**
- Discovered that *different species had different compositions of bases* proving that **DNA provided molecular diversity among species**, making it more of a contender.

- Chargaff also discovered that the *number of adenines equaled the number of thymines* and the *number of guanines equaled the number of cytosines*.
- Led to the creation of [[Chargaff's Rules]].
## Building a Structural Model of DNA
- **James Watson** and **Francis Crick** discovered the 3D structure of [[DNA]]
- Using **X-ray crystallography**, Watson was able to look at a DNA sample provided by **Rosalind Franklin** and recognized the *diffraction pattern* to be that of a *helical structure*.
- Photo added to earlier data obtained by Franklin and others *suggesting width of the helix and the spacing of nitrogenous bases*.
- Photo implied helix was made of **two strands**, which is why we call it a **double helix**.

- Watson and Crick began *creating models of a double helix* that conform to the **X-ray measurements and what was then known about the chemistry of DNA**, including [[Chargaffs Rules]].
	- They also had to change their models at one point to conform to the recently discovery that the **sugar-phosphate backbones** were *on the outside of the DNA molecule*.
		- Negatively charged phosphate groups facing aqueous surroundings
		- Hydrophobic nitrogenous bases facing inwards
	- Watson created such a model, in which the **two sugar-phosphate** backbones are [[Antiparallel|antiparallel]].
- The **nitrogenous bases** of the double helix are *paired in specific combinations*:
	- Adenine (A) with Thymine (T)
	- Guanine (G) with Cytosine (C)

**Possible Base Pairings**
![[Pasted image 20211124200823.png]]
- **Adenine and Guanine** are [[Purines|purines]]
- **Thymine and Cytosine** are [[Pyrimidines|pyrimidines]]

**Base pairings in DNA**
![[Pasted image 20211124201416.png]]
- Each base has **chemical side groups** that can *form hydrogen bonds with its appropriate partner*:
	- Adenine can form two hydrogen bonds with thymine and only thymine
	- Guanine forms three hydrogen bonds with cytosine and only cytosine
- Ultimately explains [[Chargaffs Rules]].
