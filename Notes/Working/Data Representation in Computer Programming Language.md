# Data Representation in Computer Programming Language
___
- ==Data== is the **key component** in a computer program
	- Computer programs process **data** *according to a designed algorithm*
- These programs use ==variables== to *represent data*
- Two pieces of information associated with **data**:
	- [[Data value]]
	- [[Data type]]
- Computer uses ==binary== to *represent data*
- **8-bit of binary** makes one **byte**, which is the *base unit of ==computer memory==*
- [[Data type]] is an attribute to interpret the **binary stored in computer memory**
- A ==variable== has a **name** and a **value**
	- Name must start with an letter then can be followed by other letters, numbers, and underscores
	- Value can be updated any time
	- In MATLAB, we can also update its type
- [[Using Arrays|Arrays]] are the *basic data unit in MATLAB*
	- **Scalar** is a special case of array that has one row and one column
