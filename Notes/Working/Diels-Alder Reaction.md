# Diels-Alder Reaction
---
## Introduction
- Basic **Diels-alder reaction** is what we call a [[2 + 4 Reaction]]
- An [[Alkenes|alkene]] reacts with a [[Dienes|diene]].

- The **dieneophile** is the [[Electron Donating Groups|electron donor]]
- *2 new bonds are formed at once*

## Making the Diels-alder Reaction More Favorable
![[Pasted image 20211115235905.png]]
- The simplest **Diels Alder reaction**, *that being between butadiene and ethene* is ==not very favorable==.
	- It has a **large** [[Activate Energy|enery of activation]].
- How can we make it more favorable?
	- We *add substituents that* **enhance the flow of electrons**.

- Let's Look at the [[Molecular Orbitals]] to see what is necessary for a more favorable reaction.
- The [[HOMO]] of the [[Dienes|diene]] *needs to be closer* to the [[LUMO]] of the [[Alkenes|alkene]].
- The **diene** *needs to be a better base*
	- It is base since it is accepting electrons
- Goal: **close gap** between [[HOMO]] of base and [[LUMO]] of acid by either *making base a better base* or *making a better acid*
- How to make **diene** a better base:
	- Add *more electrons*
	- Add an [[Electron Donating Groups|electron donating group]].
	- Raise [[HOMO]]
-  How to make **alkene** a better acid:
	- Remove *electrons*
	- Add an [[Electron Withdrawing Groups|electron withdrawing group]].
	- Lower [[LUMO]]

## Stereo Chemistry of the Diels-alder Reaction
![[Pasted image 20211116001219.png]]
- The [[Stereochemistry|stereochemistry]] of the **dienophile** is *preserved*.
- If **two groups** are [[Cis/Trans Conformations|cis]] in the alkene, they are [[Cis/Trans Conformations|cis]] in the [[Cyclohexane|cyclohexane]].
	- [[Cis/Trans Conformations|Trans]] gives **trans**.

- Firstly, make the diene into a [[Cis/Trans Conformations|cis formation]].
	- Rotate **one side** of the double bond on an axis *perpendicular to the plane the double bond rests on*.
- **"t"s** will be [[Cis/Trans Conformations|cis]] on the back side
- **"c"s** will be [[Cis/Trans Conformations|cis]] on the front side
- **"m"s** will be on the double bond

## 8 Possible Products of the Diels-Alder Reaction (Only one right answer)
![[Pasted image 20211116002325.png]]
- First lets look at the [[Regiochemistry|regiochemistry]] and see how we can get the two [[Constitutional Isomers|constitutional isomers]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20211116002624.png]]
		- So we can determine [[Partial Charges|partial charges]] by *moving the electrons around*.
		- Opposite match up in this reaction
		- Clearly the **1-2** and **1-4** positions work
		- Structures *c,d,g,h* are ruled out as they connect via the**1-3** positions.
		- *b and f* are ruled out as well as the [[Endothermic Products|endo]] has more overlap with the HOMO and LUMO than the [[Exothermic Products|exo]] does
			- ![[Pasted image 20211116003450.png]]
		- Why is it not *e*, just refer to the [[Stereochemistry|stereochemistry]] again and see that it has to be *facing backwards* when reacting.
			- Can be seen as well when looking at the **HOMO and LUMO overlap**
