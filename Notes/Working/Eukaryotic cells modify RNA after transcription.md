# Eukaryotic cells modify RNA after transcription
---
- **Eukaryotic mRNAs** undergo [[RNA processing]], which includes [[RNA splicing]], *the addition of a modified nucleotide [[5′ cap]] to the 5′ end*, and *the addition of a [[poly-A tail]] to the 3′ end*. 
	- The processed [[mRNA]] includes an *untranslated region* (5′ UTR or 3′ UTR) at **each end of the coding segment**.

- Most *eukaryotic genes* are **split into segments**: They have [[Introns|introns]] interspersed among the [[Exons|exons]] (the regions included in the [[mRNA]]). 
- In [[RNA splicing]], *introns are removed and exons joined.*

- [[RNA splicing]] is typically carried out by [[Spliceosomes|spliceosomes]], but in some cases, [[RNA]] alone **catalyzes its own splicing** . 
- In making a [[Primary Transcript|primary transcript]] from a gene, **RNA polymerase II** *transcribes both [[Introns|introns]] and [[Exons|exons]]* from the DNA, but the [[mRNA]] molecule that enters the [[Cytoplasm|cytoplasm]] is an ==abridged version==.
---
- *The properties of RNA* allow some [[RNA]]s (called [[ribozymes]]) to act as catalysts. 
- The *presence of introns* allows for [[alternative RNA splicing]].
- [[Proteins]] often have a *modular architecture consisting of discrete structural and functional regions* called [[domains]].

- The presence of [[Introns|introns]] in a gene may **facilitate the evolution of new and potentially beneficial proteins** as a result of a process known as *exon shuffling*
	- [[Introns]] **increase the probability of crossing over between the [[Exons|exons]] of alleles of a gene**—simply by *providing more terrain for crossovers without interrupting coding sequences*
	- While most of the shuffling would result in *nonbeneficial changes*, **occasionally a beneficial variant might arise**.
