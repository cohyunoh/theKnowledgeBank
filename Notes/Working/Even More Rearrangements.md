- Boot off the water and rearrange the carbon bonds
- Attack again with the water
- Boot off proton
## Curtius Rearrangement
![[Pasted image 20211116013820.png]]
- Lose $N_2$ first
## Interesting Ring Expansion
![[Pasted image 20211116014018.png]]
- Gotta create those positive charges so we can attack them *intramolecularly*
## Rearrangements can also happen in Base

- Difference, the **hydroxide ion attacks**.
## Use Aromaticity to Advantage
![[Pasted image 20211116014232.png]]
- Utilize that electron flow
## Lewis acid $BF_3$ As a Proton

- Opens up [[Epoxides|epoxide]]
- *Opens the ring*
## Taking a Double Six-membered Ring to a Five-and Seven-membered Ring
![[Pasted image 20211116014537.png]]
- It's in base so base attacks
- Strategically choose which hydrogen to take away
