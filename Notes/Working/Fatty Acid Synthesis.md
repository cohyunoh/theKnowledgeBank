# Fatty Acid Synthesis
---
## What is it all based on?
- **Acetyl-coenzyme A**

---
![[Pasted image 20211130202815.png]]
- It is a [[Thioester|thioester]]

---
## Furthermore ...
- Everything will be built by the [[Acetyl groups|acetyl groups]] on **acetyl-coenzyme A**.
- How could nature make **acetyl-conenzyme A** even more reactive?
	- *Add a beta-carbonyl* to make [[Thioester|thioester]] **more reactive**
	- ![[Pasted image 20211130203505.png]]
	- Potential [[Decarboxylation|decarboxylation]] can *drive further reactions*
	- It uses [[Biotin|biotin]], which is one of *Nature's reagents for biosynthesis*.
## Using Biotin to Synthesize Malonyl-CoA

- The nitrogen in the product with a double bond attached is really [[Nucleophilic|nucleophilic]]

---
![[Pasted image 20211130222615.png]]
- We reform that positively charged nitrogen group
- We add on a $CO_2$

---
![[Pasted image 20211130222757.png]]
- Malonyl-coenzyme A is made

---
## Nature's Reagents for Biosynthesis
- **Acetyl - CoA**
	- ![[Pasted image 20211130223021.png]]
- **Malonyl - CoA**
	- ![[Pasted image 20211130223049.png]]
- Both of these can react with a **Acyl Carrier Protein** (*ACP-SH*)
	- They both *get attached to the carrier protein*:
		- ![[Pasted image 20211130223156.png]]
- The **Acetyl - CoA** will act as the *primer* for the **fatty acid chain**
- The **Malonyl - CoA** will act as the *extender* for the **fatty acid chain**
## The Process
---
![[Pasted image 20211130223417.png]]
- [[Decarboxylation]] takes place first

---
![[Pasted image 20211130223454.png]]
- [[Enolates|Enolate]] attacks forming a **tetrahedral intermediate**

---
![[Pasted image 20211130223617.png]]
- Kicks off the **good leaving group** (*sulfur group*)

---
![[Pasted image 20211130223716.png]]
- NADPH is used to reduce
- ![[Pasted image 20211130223806.png]]
- **Reminder:**
	- ![[Pasted image 20211130224021.png]]
	- [[Oxidations and Reductions|Reductions]] "most likely" use **NADPH**
	- [[Oxidations and Reductions|Oxidations]] "most likely"
	 use **NAD+**
	- ==Hydride Abstraction and Delivery==
		- ![[Pasted image 20211130224147.png]]

---
![[Pasted image 20211130224310.png]]
- This happens readily because **there is a hydroxyl group beta to a carbonyl**

---
![[Pasted image 20211130224409.png]]
- *Fatty acids are all single bonds* so we need to reduce one more time:
	- ![[Pasted image 20211130224444.png]]
		- A **conjugate addition**
	
---
![[Pasted image 20211130224655.png]]
- It goes again

---
![[Pasted image 20211130224740.png]]
- Uses the *extender*

---
## The Factory
![[Pasted image 20211130224906.png]]
- This is where all of the processes outlined previously take place

---
![[Pasted image 20211130224954.png]]
- This shows where in the synthase each process take place
## The Product of FAS Enzyme
![[Pasted image 20211130225218.png]]
- The *FAS enzyme* is what encourages this whole process and when combined with ==one primer and seven extenders==, along with the necessary addons, we get **Palmetic Acid**.
- You need two moles of **NADPH** for each *extension*
	- One mole to reduce carbonyl
	- One mole to reduce double bond
- Heavier acids use **Palmetic Acid** as a *primer*:
