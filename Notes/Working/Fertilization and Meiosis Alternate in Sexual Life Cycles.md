# Fertilization and Meiosis Alternate in Sexual Life Cycles
---
- Normal human [[Somatic Cells|somatic cells]] are [[Diploid|diploid]]. They have **46 chromosomes** made up of two sets of 23 [[Chromosomes|chromosomes]], *one set from each parent*.
- Human diploid cells have **22 pairs** of [[Homologs|homologs]] that are [[Autosomes|autosomes]], and one pair of [[Sex chromosomes|sex chromosomes]]; the latter typically determines whether the person is *female (XX) or male (XY)*.
- In humans, **ovaries and testes** produce [[Haploid Gametes|haploid gametes]] by [[Meiosis|meiosis]], each [[Gametes|gamete]] containing a *single set of 23* [[Chromosomes|chromosomes]] ($n=23$).
- During [[Fertilization|fertilization]], an **egg and sperm** unite, forming a [[Diploid|diploid]] ($2n=46$) single-celled [[Zygote|zygote]], which develops into a *multicellular organism* is produced by [[Mitosis|mitosis]].
- **Sexual life cycles** differ in the timing of [[Meiosis|meiosis]] relative to [[Fertilization|fertilization]] and in the *point(s) of the cycle* at which a **multicellular organism** is produced by [[Mitosis|mitosis]].
