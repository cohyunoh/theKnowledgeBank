# Genes Specify Proteins via Transcription and Translation
---
- Beadle and Tatum’s studies of *mutant strains* of **Neurospora** led to the [[one gene–one polypeptide hypothesis]]. 
- During [[Gene Expression|gene expression]], the *information encoded in* [[Genes|genes]] *is used to make specific* [[Polypeptides|polypeptide chains]] (enzymes and other proteins) or **RNA molecules**.
---
- [[Transcription]] is the **synthesis of RNA** *complementary to a template strand of DNA*. 
- [[Translation]] is the **synthesis of a polypeptide** whose *amino acid sequence is specified by the nucleotide sequence* in [[mRNA|messenger RNA]] (mRNA).
- [[Transcription]] and [[Translation|translation]] occur in all organisms.
	- There is one main difference in the **flow of genetic information** between [[Eukaryotes|eukaryotes]] and [[Prokaryotes|prokaryotes]]:
		- *Bacteria (prokaryotes) do not have nuclei*
		- They do not have *nuclear membranes* that **separate bacterial [[DNA]] and[[ mRNA]] from [[Ribosomes|ribosomes]]** and the other *protein-synthesizing equipment*
	- [[Transcription]] **occurs in the nucleus**, but the [[mRNA]] must be *transported* to the [[Cytoplasm|cytoplasm]] for [[Translation|translation]].
- In [[Eukaryotes|eukaryotes]], before **RNA transcripts from protein-coding genes** can *leave the nucleus*, they are ==modified in various ways to produce the final==, functional [[mRNA]].
- The **initial RNA transcript** from any [[Genes|gene]], *including those specifying [[RNA]] that is not translated into protein*, is generally referred to as the [[Primary Transcript|primary transcript]]

- Summary:
	- [[Genes]] program *protein synthesis* via *genetic messages* in the form of [[mRNA|messenger RNA]]. 
	- Put another way, cells are governed by a molecular chain of command with a directional flow of genetic information.

---
- Genetic information *is encoded as a sequence of* **nonoverlapping nucleotide triplets**, or [[Codons|codons]]. 
	- There are 20 [[Amino Acids|amino acids]], and that means we need to *be able to code those 20 from 4*[[Nucleotides|nucleotides]]
		- This can be done if we have a **triplet of nucleotides**
			- $4^3=64$
	- Experiments have verified that the flow of information from gene to protein is based on a [[Triplet Code|triplet code]]
- During [[Transcription|transcription]], the [[Genes|gene]] **determines the sequence of [[Nucleotides|nucleotide bases]]** along the length of the [[RNA|RNA molecule]] that is *being synthesized* based off of a [[Template Strand|template strand]]
	- The [[mRNA]] is complementary to the [[Template Strand|template strand]] as they are made **based on pairing rules**
	- RNA pairs are similar to DNA pairs, except that *U (the RNA substitute for T) pairs with A and the mRNA nucleotides contain ribose instead of deoxyribose*.
	- RNA is also synthesized in the [[Antiparallel|antiparallel]] direction
- A [[Codons|codon]] in [[mRNA]] either *is translated into an amino acid* (==61 of the 64 codons==) or *serves as a stop signal* (==3 codons==). 
	- [[Codons]] are customarily written in the 5′→3′ direction.
	- The term *codon* is also used for the *DNA nucleotide triplets* along the **nontemplate strand**
		- These codons are *complementary* to the [[Template Strand|template strand]] and thus identical in sequence to the [[mRNA]] (except for T’s instead of U’s)
		- For this reason, the **nontemplate DNA strand** is often called the [[Coding Strand|coding strand]]
- The [[Codons|codons]] are **read by the translation machinery in the 5′→3′ direction** along the [[mRNA]] during [[Translation|translation]].

---
Note: Because *codons are nucleotide triplets*, the **number of nucleotides** making up a genetic message must be ==three times== the **number of amino acids** in the protein product.

- [[Codons]] must be read in the correct [[Reading Frame|reading frame]].
	- Consider this statement: “The red dog ate the bug.” Group the letters incorrectly by starting at the wrong point, and the result will probably be gibberish: for example, “her edd oga tet heb ug.”
