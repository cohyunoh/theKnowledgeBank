# Genetic Variation Produced in Sexual Life Cycles Contributes to Evolution
---
- **Three events** in [[Sexual Reproduction|sexual reproductuion]] contribute to *genetic variation* in a population
	- [[Independent assortment]] of [[Chromosomes|chromosomes]] during [[Meiosis I|meiosis I]].
	- **Crossing over** during [[Meiosis I|meiosis I]].
	- Random [[Fertilization|fertilization]] of *egg cells by sperm*.
	- During crossing over, [[DNA]] of **nonsister chromatids** in a *homologous pair is broken and rejoined*.
- **Genetic variation** is the raw material for *evolution by natural selection*. **Mutations** are the original source of this variation.
- *Recombination of variant genes* generates additional **genetic diversity**.
