# Inheritance Patterns are Often More Complex than Predicted by Simple Mendelian Genetics
---
- In the 1900s, **geneticists** extended Mendelian principles *not only to diverse organisms*, but also to **patterns of inheritance** *more complex than those described by Mendel*.
- The **inheritance of** [[Character (Biology)|characters]] determined by a **single gene** *deviates from simple Mendelian patterns* when [[Alleles|alleles]] are not completely [[Trait (Biology)#^3e2061|dominant]] or [[Trait (Biology)#^cc96c8|recessive]], when a particular [[Genes|gene]] has *more than two alleles*, or when a **single gene** produces *multiple* [[Phenotypes|phenotypes]].
## Degrees of Dominance
- [[Alleles]] can show *different degrees of* **dominance and recessiveness** in relation to each other.
- In Mendel's **classic pea crosses**, the **$F_1$ offspring** always looked like *one of the two* parental varieties because *one allele in a pair showed* [[Complete Dominance|complete dominance]].
- For **some genes**, however, neither [[Alleles|allele]] is *completely dominant*, and the **$F_1$ hybrids** have a [[Phenotypes|phenotype]] somewhere between those of the *two parental varieties*.
	- This phenomenon is called [[Incomplete Dominance|incomplete dominance]].

- Another variation on **dominance relationships** between [[Alleles|alleles]] is called [[Codominance|codominance]]. 
## Relationship Between Dominance and Phenotype
- For any [[Character (Biology)|character]], the **observed dominant/recessive relationship** of [[Alleles|alleles]] depends on the *level at which we examine the phenotype*.
	- Some things may be recessive when compared to a general population, but when we scope in closer to the population that just has that type of gene, it may actually be dominant.
## Multiple Alleles

## Pleiotropy
- Most [[Genes|genes]] have *multiple phenotypic effects*, a property called [[Pleiotropy|pleiotropy]].
- In the **garden pea**, the gene that *determines flower color* also affects **the color of the coating on the outer surface of the seed** which can be *gray or white*.
## Extending Mendelian Genetics for Two or More Genes
- [[Epistasis]]
- [[Polygenic Inheritance]]
## Nature and Nurture: the Environmental Impact on the Phenotype

- Generally, the **phenotypic range** is the *broadest* for **polygenic characters**.
- **Environment** contributes to the *quantitative nature of these characters*.
- Geneticists refer to such [[Character (Biology)|characters]] as [[Multifactorial|multifactorial]].
