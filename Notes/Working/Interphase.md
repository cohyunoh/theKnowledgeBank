# Interphase
---
Divided into *three phases*:
- $G_1$ Phase (**the first gap**) [[G1 Phase|Expand]]
- $S$ Phase (**synthesis**) [[S Phase|Expand]]
- $G_2$ Phase (**the second gap**) [[G2 Phase|Expand]]

During all three phases, *intense [[Metabolism|metabolic activity]] and growth occur*. 

A cell grows by *producing [[proteins]]* and *[[cytoplasmic organelles]]*. ^ec9310
