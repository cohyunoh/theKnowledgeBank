# Interview with Professor Hammond
---

- So I know we talked previously about how your life has crossed paths with Alzheimerâ€™s disease, so would you like to elaborate first on your experience with your father?

	took two directions: would make puns because he couldn't make conversation and he was anxious that he needed to be somewhere 
	
	did not know what it was before doctor
	
	felt he was no longer his father
	
	made his dying easier
	
	
	- Did you know right away that he had the disease or was there a time when your suspicions started arising?
	- What things did he start to do that hinted that he was suffering from the disease?
	- What did it make you feel?
	- Was this something you knew one day would happen, even if you did not want it to, or did you not think about it as an inevitability?
	- Did the experience warn you about the disease, as in have you taken any precautionary measures to prevent the disease for yourself? If you have, then what have you done? If not, then why?
		- 
- How do you learn about new things?
	- Do you see social media as the way people today find out about stuff? If yes, then do you believe that utilizing social media and using its ability to make things go viral is a way to spread awareness? If no, then why not; what do you see as the main way for people to learn new things?
- What is your experience so far with Alzheimer's disease?
	- If you were to get the disease, hopefully you don't, then how would you want your family to treat you?
	- What do you fear the most with the disease?
