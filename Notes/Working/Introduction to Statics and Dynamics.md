# Introduction to Statics and Dynamics
---
## Mechanics and Historical Perspective
- **Mechanics** is concerned with *the motion and deformation of bodies that are subjected to forces*
	- Origins of mechanics may lie with [[Archimedes]](287-212 BC)
	- Everything is subject to forces
	- Lots of things are in motion
	- Everything technically deforms, but a lot of times ==not signficantly==
		- There is no actual rigid bodies
- Galileo conducted first experiments in [[dynamics]]
- Newton formulated the [[laws of motion]] and [[gravity]]
## Branches of Mechanics/Classifications (Incomplete)
- Solid vs. Fluid(liquid or gas)
- [[Solids]] can be *rigid* or *deformable*
	- All real materials are deformable; rigid means the deformation is not significant
- Rigid materials can be under [[static loading]] or [[dynamic loading]]
- Kinematics is a branch of [[dynamics]] that is only consiered with the geometric/time-dependent motion (no force analysis)
- Kinetics
## Rigid vs. Deformable Bodies
- Rigid body analysis is only concerned with the external forces that are applied into the body
	- It is assumed that all (if any) internal forces summate to zero
- Deformable body analyses is concerned with how the external forces effect the internal reorganization of bodies
- For BME 303/305
	- Elastic deformation: all deformations are recovered
	- Plastic deformation: all deformations are permanent
	- Fluids: continually defomr under a constant external load
## Overall Idealizations Used at Some Points
- Particle: A particle has mass but has no size asociated with 
	- (e.g. the size of the Earth is negligible as compared with the size of its orbit)
- Rigid Body: A combination of particles; all the particles remain at a fixed distance from each other, before and after loading
	- The deformation is negligible
	- (Pic of ring from slides)
		- It can be both a rigid body and a particle
		- Rigid body: It requires knowing the ring's geometry and the angle the hooks are tugging at for this model
		- Particle: The geometry does not matter. The hooks and chain act a singular point for this model
- Concentrated Force: The overalll effect of a loading condition that is assumed to at at one point
	- (Pic of train wheel on track)
		- Assume only one point of contact, but in reality it can be deformed
## Biomechanics and Historical Perspective
- Biomechanics is concerned with the application of mechanics principles to biology/physiology
- Leonardo da Vinci
## Basic Concepts
- Basic concepts are fundamental units of measurement that are not dependent on each other
	- For Newtonian mechanics, these include:
		- Length, time, and mass (using SI units)
		- Or length, time, and force (using English units)
	- Note that once the basic concepts are defined, all other variables can be defined from the basic ones
- There are many other values that will be defined throughout your engineering career
	- Velocity, acceleration, force (or mass), energy, moment, momentum, ...
## Newton's Laws (Incomplete)
- 1st: A body that is originally at rest will remain at rest, or a body in motion will move in a straight line with constant velocity, if the net force on the body is zero
	- (pic)
- 2nd: A body with a net force acting on it will accelerate in the direction of
	- (pic)
- 3rd:
	- (pic)
## Newton's Law of Gravitational Attraction (Incomplete)
- This governs the gravitational attraction between two particls
	- $F = G [(m_1 * m_2)/r^2]$
- $G=66.73*10^-12$ $m^3/kgs^2$ 
- $F=weight=mg$
- $g$ is determined at sea level at 45 degrees latitude
not complete
## Dimensional Analysis and Units
- Very important to make sure you have proper quantities; meant to determine what the units should be
	- e.g. $[AREA]=[LENGTH][LENGTH]=[LENGTH]^2$
- Units are arbitrary measurements of these dimensions
## Numerical Calculations
- All equations must be dimensionally homogenous 
	- $s=vt+(1/2)at^2$
	- Each quantity is in dimensions of length
- ==SIG FIGS==
	- Write a decimal point or two after calculating entirely in calculator
## Cartesian Coordinate System (incomplete)
- The normal Cartesian system is a **right-handed system**
- Any vector can be broken
## Vector Representation (Incomplete)
