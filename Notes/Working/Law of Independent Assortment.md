# The Law of Independent Assortment
---
Deals with [[Dihybrids|dihybrids]].

Imagine *crossing two* [[True-Breeding|true-breeding]] **pea varieties** that in *both of these characters*:
- (YYRR) ==Yellow and Round==
- (yyrr) ==Green and Wrinkled==

The [[F1 Generation]] will be [[Dihybrids|dihybrids]] (YyRr).

**Independent Assortment** treat the Y, R and y, r alleles as independent from each other which means when doing [[Punnett Square]], it does not have to be YR and yr being compared.
