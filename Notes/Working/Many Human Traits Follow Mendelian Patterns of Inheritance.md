# Many Human Traits Follow Mendelian Patterns of Inheritance
---
## Pedigree Analysis
- In place of **breeding experiments**, geneticists *analyze the results of human matings that have already occurred*.
	- They *collect data* about a family's history for a **particular trait** and *assemble this data into a* **family tree** describing the [[Trait (Biology)|trait]] across generations - a family [[Pedigrees|pedigree]].

- [[Pedigrees]] are a more *serious matter* when the [[Alleles|alleles]] in question cause **disabling or deadly diseases** of innocuous human variations such as *hairline or inability to taste a harmless chemical*.
## Recessively Inherited Disorders
- *Thousands of genetic disorders* are known to be inherited as **simple recessive traits**.
- The **severity** of these disorders range from *relatively mild to life-threatening*.
### The Behavior of Recessive Alleles
- An [[Alleles|allele]] that *causes a genetic disorder* codes for either a **malfunctioning protein** or **no protein at all**.
- In the case of *disorders classified as recessive*, [[Heterozygous|heterozygotes]] typically have the **normal phenotype**  because **one copy of the normal allele** *produces a sufficient amount of the specific protein*. 
	- Nevertheless, these [[Heterozygous|heterozygous]] individuals may *transmit the recessive allele* to their offspring and thus are called [[Carriers|carriers]].
- This means that **recessively inherited disorders** only show up in the [[Homozygous|homozygous]] individuals who *inherit a recessive allele from each parent*.

- In general, **genetic disorders** are *not evenly distributed among all groups of people*.
- When a **disease-causing recessive allele** is rare, it is *relatively unlikely* that two [[Carriers|carriers]] of the same harmful [[Alleles|allele]] will *meet and mate*.
	- This why **inbreeding** leads to a lot of defects.
### Cystic Fibrosis
- The *most common lethal genetic disease* in the U.S. is [[Cystic Fibrosis|cystic fibrosis]], which strikes **one out of every 2,500 people** of European descent but is much rarer in other groups.
- The **normal allele** for this [[Genes|gene]] codes for a **membrane protein** that functions in the *transport of chloride ions between certain cells and the extracellular fluid*.
- These **chloride transport channels** are *defective or absent* in the plasma membranes of children who inherit the **two recessive alleles** for cystic fibrosis.
## Sickle-Cell Disease: A Genetic Disorder with Evolutionary Implications
- The most common **inherited disorder** among people of African descent is [[Sickle-Cell Disease|sickle-cell disease]].
- It is caused by the *substitution of a single* [[Amino Acids|amino acid]] in the **hemoglobin protein** of red blood cells.
	- in [[Homozygous|homozygous]] individuals, all hemoglobin is of the *sickle-cell variety*.
- This is a case where in the [[Heterozygous|heterozygote]], the normal allele is [[Incomplete Dominance|incompletely dominant]].

## Dominantly Inherited Disorders
- Dwarfism is an example of this
- Refer to [[Complete Dominance]]

## Multifactorial Disorders
- Refer to [[Multifactorial]]
## Genetic Testing
- [[Probability Laws Govern Mendelian Inheritance]]
	- **Probability laws** are used *to give counseling to couples* based on their [[Pedigrees|pedigrees]]
### Tests for Identifying Carriers
- **Fetal Testing**
	- *Screening Tests*
		- Imaging and blood tests
	- *Diagnostic Tests*
		- [[Amniocentesis]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20211113010538.png]]
		- [[Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS)]]
- **Newborn Screening**
	- Tests can also be done after birth
