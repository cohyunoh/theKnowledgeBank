## The Basic Principle: Base Pairing to a Template Strand
- Watson and Crick's sequel: **How DNA replicates**:
	- Their model of [[DNA]] is *a pair of templates*
		- Each is *complementary to each other*
	- Prior to duplication, **hydrogen bonds break** and the **two chains unwind and separate**
	- Each chain then serves as a **template** for the formation of a *new companion chain*
	- Two pairs of chains will result and the bases will be ==exactly duplicated==

- Know the difference between the [[Semi-Conservative Model|semi-conservative model]] and the [[Conservative Model|conservative model]].
- There's also the [[Dispersive Model|dispersive model]]
- After experiments done at **CalTech**, the [[Semi-Conservative Model]] was *proven to be correct*

## DNA Replication
### Introduction
- Each of your [[Somatic Cells|somatic cells]] has **46 DNA molecules** in its [[Nucleus|nucleus]], *one long double-helical molecule* per [[Chromosomes|chromosome]].
- **Replication of chromosomal DNA** begins at particular sites called [[Origins of Replication|origins of replication]].
- Proteins that *initiate DNA replication* recognize this sequence and attach to [[DNA]], **separating the two strands and opening up a** ==replication bubble==.
- Replication of DNA then proceeds in **both directions** *until the entire molecule is copied*.

---
- At each end of the **replication bubble** is a [[Replication Fork|replication fork]]
- [[Helicases]] are enzymes that untwist the double helix at the [[Replication Fork|replication forks]], *separating the two parental strands and making them available as template strands*
- After the parental strands separate, [[Single-strand Binding Proteins|single-strand binding proteins]], bind to the **unpaired strands**, keeping them from repairing.
- [[Topoisomerase]] plays a big role here.

### Synthesizing a New DNA Strand
- With the unwound sections of **parental DNA strands** being available to *serve as templates*, DNA synthesis can begin.
- However, enzymes responsible for *synthesizing DNA* can only add onto **already existing chains that is base-paired with the template chain**.
	- An **initial nucleotide chain** that is used as a *pre-existing chain* is made during ==DNA synthesis==: a short stretch of RNA
- The **RNA chain** that serves as the pre-existing chain is called a [[Primer|primer]].
	- It is synthesized by an enzyme [[Primase|primase]].
- [[Primase]] starts a **complementary RNA chain** with a *single RNA nucleotide* and *adds RNA nucleotides* one at a time, using the parent strand as a template.
- The **completed** [[Primer|primer]], generally *five to ten nucleotides long*, is thus **base-paired** to the template strand.
- The **new strand** will start from the $3'$ end of the RNA Primer.
- [[DNA Polymerases]] *catalyze the synthesis of new DNA*
	- Most require [[Primer|primers]] and a **DNA template strand**
	- **DNA polymerase III** adds a DNA nucleotide to the RNA [[Primer|primer]] and then *continues adding DNA nucleotides* to the growing end of the new DNA strand.
- Each **nucleotide** to be added to a growing DNA strand consists of a *sugar attached to a base and to three phosphate groups*.
	- The sugar differentiates this from ATP for it has **deoxyribose** while ATP has **ribose**
	- **Nucleotides are reactive** due to their *triphosphate tails*
- [[DNA Polymerases|DNA polymerase]] catalyzes the **addition of each monomer to the growing end of a DNA strand** by *a condensation reaction where two phosphate groups are lost as a molecule of* [[Pyrophosphate|pyrophosphate]]
	- The subsequent hydrolysis of the [[Pyrophosphate|pyrophosphate]] to two molecules of **inorganic phosphate** is *coupled in a exergonic reaction that helps drive the polymerization reaction*

### Antiparallel Elongation
- Two ends of strand are different, giving **directionality**
- The two strands of DNA in a **double helix** are **antiparallel** (*they are oriented in opposite directions of each other*).
	- Therefore, the two strands formed during DNA replication must also be antiparallel to their template strands
- [[DNA Polymerases]] can only *add to the 3' end of the* [[Primer|primer]] or growing DNA strand
	- A new DNA strand can only elongate in the 5' to 3' direction.
- **DNA pol III** follows this convention, *adding nucleotides in the 5' to 3' direction* from the [[Primer|primer]] as the [[Replication Fork|fork]] progresses.
	- The strand created from this process is called the [[Leading Strand|leading strand]]
![[Pasted image 20211129213822.png]]
---
- To elongate the **other new strand** going in the opposite direction of the [[Replication Fork|replication fork]], the **DNA pol III** must still *follow the 5' to 3' direction*
	- This strand is referred to as the [[Lagging Strand|lagging strand]]
- The [[Lagging Strand|lagging strand]] is **synthesized discontinuously**, as a series of segments called [[Okazaki Fragments]]. 
- [[DNA ligase]] is what combines these [[Okazaki Fragments]] together

### The DNA Replication Complex
- It is conventional to treat **DNA polymerase molecules** as ==locomotives== moving along a DNA rail track
	- Such a model is *inaccurate in two distinct ways*:
		1. The various proteins that participate in DNA replication actually form a **single large complex**: *a DNA replication machine*.
			- Its **efficiency** is dependent on *protein-protein interactions*
				- Example:
					- By *interacting with other proteins at the fork*, [[Primase|primase]] apparently acts as a **molecular brake**, *slowing progress of the replication fork* and *coordinating the placement of* [[Primer|primers]] and *the rates of replication on the* [[Leading Strand|leading]] *and* [[Lagging Strand|lagging]] *strands*.
		2. The DNA replication complex may **not move along the DNA**; ==DNA moves through the complex==.
			- These complexes are attached to the [[Nuclear Matrix|nuclear matrix]] as **fibers**

## Proofreading and Reparing DNA
- **Initial pairing errors** between incoming [[Nucleotides|nucleotides]] and those in the **template strand** occur at a *rate of one in $10^5$ nucleotides*.
	- However, errors in the completed DNA molecule amount to only one in 10 billion nucleotides, an error rate that is 100,000 times lower
- During DNA replication, many [[DNA Polymerases|DNA polymerases]] **proofread each nucleotide against its template** as soon as it is *covalently bonded to the growing strand*.
	- fixes it like how one fixes a text message
- [[Mismatch Repair]] catches **mismatched nucleotides** which are missed by the [[DNA Polymerases|DNA polymerase]].
- Incorrectly paired or altered nucleotides can also **arise after replication.**
	- Genetic material always needs to *be cared for and repaired*
	- DNA molecules are constantly subjected to *potentially harmful chemical and physical agents*, leading to **mutations**.
- In many cases, a *segment of the strand containing the damage is cut out (excised)* by a **DNA-cutting enzyme**—a [[Nuclease|nuclease]]—and the resulting gap is then filled in with nucleotides, *using the undamaged strand as a template*.
	- Filled in via [[DNA Polymerases|DNA polymerase]] and [[DNA ligase]].
	- [[Nuclear Excision Repair]] is a good example of such system

---
## Evolutionary Significance of Altered DNA Nucleotides
- When the rare occurrence of **proofreading and repairing failing** happens, *evolutionary mutations can happen*.
- This led to the diversity of life we know today,.
---
## Replicating the Ends of DNA Molecules
- For **linear DNA**, such as the DNA of [[Eukaryotes|eukaryotic chromosomes]], the usual replication machinery *cannot complete the 5′ ends of daughter DNA strands* because ==there is no 3′ end of a preexisting polynucleotide for DNA polymerase to add onto==.
- As a result, **repeated rounds of replication produce shorter and shorter DNA molecules with uneven (“staggered”) ends**.

---
**Shortening of the ends of linear DNA molecules**
![[Pasted image 20211130002125.png]]

---
- Most [[Prokaryotes|prokaryotes]] have a **circular chromosome**, with no ends, *so the shortening of DNA does not occur*.
- [[Eukaryotes|Eukaryotic chromosomal]] DNA molecules have special nucleotide sequences called [[Telomeres|telomeres]] at their ends to *protect their genes from eroding.*
