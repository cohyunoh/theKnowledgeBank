# Meiosis Reduces the Number of Chromosome Sets from Diploid to Haploid
---
- The **two** [[Cell Division|cell divisions]] of [[Meiosis|meiosis]], [[Meiosis I|meiosis I]] and [[Meiosis II|meiosis II]], produce *four haploid daughter cells*. The **number of chromosome sets** is *reduced from two(diploid) to one(haploid)* during meiosis I.
- [[Meiosis]] is distinguished from [[Mitosis|mitosis]] by **three events** of [[Meiosis I|meiosis I]]:
	- [[Prophase I]]
	- [[Metaphase I]]
	- [[Anaphase I]]

- [[Meiosis II]] separates the [[Sister Chromatids|sister chromatids]].
- [[Sister chromatids|Sister chromatid]] cohesion and [[Crossing Over and Synapsis|crossing over]] allow [[Chiasmata|chiasmata]] to hold [[Homologs|homologs]] together until [[Anaphase I|anaphase I]]. [[Centromeres#^0ed091|Cohesins]]  are *cleaved along the arms*  at anaphase I, **allowing homologs to separate**, and at the [[Centromeres|centromeres]] in [[Anaphase II|anaphase II]], releasing [[Sister Chromatids|sister chromatids]] from each other.
