# Mendel Used the Scientific Approach to Identify Two Laws of Inheritance
---
- **Gregor Mendel** performed an *[[The Mendel Experiment|experiment]] with garden peas* to create a theory of inheritance.

![[The Mendel Experiment#^2368bd]]

- Some terms:
	- [[Character (Biology)|Character]]
	- [[Trait (Biology)|Trait]]
- The [[Law of Segregation|law of segregation]] states that **genes have alternative forms**, or [[Alleles|alleles]].
	- In a [[Diploid Cells|diploid organism]], the **two** [[Alleles|alleles]] **of a gene** *segregate* during [[Meiosis|meiosis]] and [[Gametes|gamete]] **formation**; each **sperm or egg** *carries only one allele of each pair*.
	- This **law** explains the **3:1 ratio** of $F_2$ [[Phenotypes|phenotypes]] observed when **monohybrids** *cross-or self-pollinate*.
	- Each organism *inherits one allele for each gene* from **each parent**.
	- In **heterozygotes**, the *two alleles are different*:
		- Expression of the [[Trait (Biology)#^3e2061|dominant allele]] masks the **phenotypic effect of the** [[Trait (Biology)#^cc96c8|recessive allele]]. 
		- (Pp [[Genotypes|genotype]]).
	- **Homozygotes** have *identical alleles* of a given gene and are therefore [[True-Breeding|true-breeding]].
		- (PP or pp [[Genotypes|genotype]])
	- ![[Pasted image 20211111234645.png]]
- [[The Test Cross|The test cross]] refers to the question now brought up if we consider dominant traits.
	- If the *purple colored flower* is **dominant**, a [[Genotypes|genotype]] of *PP* and *Pp*
- The [[Law of Independent Assortment|law of independent assortment]] states that **the pair of alleles for a given gene** *segregates into gametes* ==independently== of the pair of alleles from any other gene. 
	- In a cross between any **dihybrids**(*individuals heterozygous for two genes*), the offspring have four [[Phenotypes|phenotypes]] in a **9:3:3:1 ratio**.
