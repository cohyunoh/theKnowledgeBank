# Most Cell Division Results in Identical Daughter Cells
---
- **Unicellular** organisms reproduce by themselves via  [[Cell Division]].
- **Multicellular** organisms rely on [[Cell Division | cell division]] to *grow, repair, and develop* as soon as they are a fertilized egg.
- The [[Genome | genome]] of a cell, or its **genetic material** ([[DNA]]), is split up like [[Horcruxes]] among [[Chromosomes | chromosomes]].
- Each [[Eukaryotes | eukaryotic]] chromosome consists of one DNA molecule associated with many [[Proteins | proteins]] and the combination of the complex of DNA and associated proteins is called  [[Chromatin | chromatin]].
- [[Chromatin]] exists in *different states of [[Condensation (Chromatin) | condensation]]* at different times.
- In animals, [[Gametes]] have *one* set of chromosomes while [[Somatic Cells]] have *two*.
- Before cells go through cell division, they *replicate* their genetic material. The result is two **daughter cells** that each have a copy of the DNA.
- When the genetic material replicates, the chromosomes are *duplicated*
	- Each duplicated chromosome consists of two identical sister chromatids joined together at the center, *lengthwise*, at the **constricted region** called the [[Centromere]].
- When the *daughter cells are formed*, the **cohesion** between the two **sister chromatids** is broken and each chromatid *becomes a chromosome* for one of the daughter cells.
- **Eurkaryotic cell division** consists of [[Mitosis]](*division of the [[nucleus]]*) and [[Cytokinesis]](*division of the [[cytoplasm]]*).
