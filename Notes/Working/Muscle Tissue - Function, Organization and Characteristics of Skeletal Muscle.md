## Muscle Tissue
- All tissue in the human body can be classified into one of four types
	- **Muscle** is one of these types - this type of tissue is specialized for ==contraction==
	- **Nervous** -  transmission of ==electrical signals==
	- **Epithelial** - ==barrier tissue==
	- **Connective** - ==catch-all== (*the rest of them*)
- There are three main types of muscles
	- **Skeletal**
	- **Smooth** - organs
	- **Cardiac** - heart
## Functions of Skeletal Muscle
- ==Produce skeletal movement==: pulls on **tendons** to *move bones*, so that we can produce all sorts of motions
- ==Maintain posture/bod position==: **tension maintained in our skeletal muscle** *maintains posture*, such as head held up while sitting
- ==Supports soft tissue==: the skeletal muscles within the **abdominal wall** support the *weight of the visceral organs and protects them from many external injuries*
- ==Guard entrances and exits==: skeletal muscle *surround* the **entrances/exits of the GI tract, urinary tract, etc., e.g.** this is why we can control the bodily processes associated with these openings
- ==Maintain body temperature==: **muscle contraction** *converts chemical energy into motion and heat*; helps to keep us warm
- ==Store nutrients==: **contractile elements** can be *broken down* when diets do not contain enough proteins; this can be used **to synthesize glucose**
## Organization of Muscle Tissue
- [[Skeletal muscle]] is an organ composed of *connective tissue, muscle tissue, blood vessels and nerves*
- [[Skeletal muscle]] is composed of **bundles of [[muscle fascicles]]**, which contain *connective tissue and muscle tissue*
- [[muscle fascicles|Muscle fascicles]] are composed of *muscle fibers, which contain connective tissue and a single muscle cell*
- The [[muscle cell]] is composed of **multiple contractile elements** termed [[myofibrils]]
- ==Blood vessels and neurons== can **penetrate through the connective tissue to the muscle fiber**

## Connective Tissue in Muscle Cells
- [[Epimysium]] **separates** the *entire muscle from other tissue*
	- This is a dense layer primarily composed of ==collagen==
- [[Perimysium]] **separates** the *different fascicles*
	- Composed primarily of ==collagen and elastin==
	- Contains ==blood vessels and nerves==
- [[Endomysium]] **separates** the *individual skeletal muscle cells*
	- Composed primarily of ==elastin==
	- Contains ==blood vessels and nerves and myosatellite cells== (cells that repair muscle)
## Organization of a Muscle Cell
- The **muscle cell** is surrounded by the [[sarcolemma]] (this is the plasma membrane of muscle cells)
	- the ==sarcoplasm== is the *[[Cytoplasm|cytoplasm]] of muscle cells*
	- the ==sarcoplasmic reticulum== is like the [[Endoplasmic Reticulum|endoplasmic reticulum]]
- [[Skeletal muscle]] cells are **very large**, but the *entire cell must contract as one*
	- ==Transverse tubule== (or T tubule) system helps to accomplish
	- The muscle cell is as long as the muscle itself
- The **T-tubules** are *invaginations of the cell membrane that penetrate the entire cell*
	- this brings the **extracellular fluid** in *close proximity to all intracellular compartments*
	- The **T-tubules** can also *conduct an electrical pulse*, like all membranes

## Sarcoplasmic Reticulum
- The **SR** *forms a tubule network around each myofibril* (more on them in the following slides); this is analogous to the [[Endoplasmic Reticulum|smooth endoplasmic reticulum]] in “normal cells”
- The **SR** makes a *tight connection to the T-tubule system and locations* termed the ==triad==
	- The ==terminal cisterna== are *locations where the SR expands and forms a large chamber*
- The **SR** is a *large calcium ion store for muscle cells at a concentration up to 40,000x greater than the sarcoplasm under resting conditions*
	- Muscle cells can only contract when this calcium is released
## Myofibrils and Sarcomere
- These two terms are interchangeable
- [[myofibrils|Myofibrils]] are *composed of the contractile elements of muscle tissue*
- These regions are ~$2\mu m$ in diameter and as long as the entire cell
- [[myofibrils|Myofibrils]] are composed of **thin filaments** (*which are primarily [[Actin|actin]]*) and **thick filaments** (*which are primarily [[Myosins|myosin]]*)
	- There are other proteins that help in anchoring and organization but do not actively participate in contraction
- **Thin and thick filaments** *organize into well-defined* (and conserved structures) termed the [[sarcomere]]
## Regions within the Sarcomere
- ==A (anisotropic) band==: **region of overlap** between [[Myosins|myosin]] and [[Actin|actin]] and region of myosin only
- ==I (isotropic) band==: **region of no-overlap**, primarily contains [[Actin|actin]]
- ==M-line==: **center of the A band**, *stabilize thick filaments*
- ==H-band==: **region of thick filaments only**
- ==Zone of Overlap==: region of overlap between [[Myosins|myosin]] and [[Actin|actin]]

## Thin Filament Details (incomplete)
- ~$5-6nm$ in diameter and $1 \mu m$ in length
- Composed of:
	- [[Filamentous Actin]] (F-actin): which is braided strand of 2 globular actin chains
	- [[Nebulin]]: a protein that is in between 
	- [[Tropomyosin]]:
	- [[Troponin]]:
## Thick Filament Details (incomplete)
- $10-12nm$ in diameter and $1.6 |mu m$ in length
- Composed of:
	- [[Myosins|Myosin]]
	- [[Titin]]
- Myosin

## Thin and Thick Filaments/Contraction Comparison (Figure Missing)
- Relaxed: no cross bridges (red not touching purple)
- Contracted: cross bridges and shorter
## Overview of Different Muscle Types (incomplete and missing figure)
- [[Parallel Muscles]]
	- The majority of skeletal muscles take this form (e.g. biceps)
- [[Convergent muscles]]
	- The muscles spread like a fan (e.g. pectoral)
- [[Pennate muscle]]
	- These muscles are not as efficient as parallel muscles (think of the moment arm) (e.g. deltoid muscle)
- [[Circular muscles]]
	- Entrances/exit sphincter (e.g. or
## Muscles Make Use of Levers to Increase Efficiency
- The **nature** and **site of connection to bones** dictates *the force, speed and range of motion*
- ==Bones== act as the **lever**, which move about a fixed point termed the fulcrum
- The bones move based on a force applied by the muscles
- [[1st Class Lever]]
- [[2nd Class Lever]]
	- A small force can move a large load (due to moment arms); however load does not move very far
- [[3rd Class Lever]]
	- Most common in the body
	- A large force is needed, but the load can move large distances
	- Think of bicep curls
