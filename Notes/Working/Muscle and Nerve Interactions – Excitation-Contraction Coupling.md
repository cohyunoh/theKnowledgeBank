## Cholinergic Synapse
- ==Cholinergic synapses== are those that use **acetylcholine (ACh)** as the [[neurotransmitters]]
	- **ACh** is the *most wide‐spread and most often studied neurotransmitter* and thus these junctions are fairly well understood
- ACh is released:
	- at **all neuromuscular junctions** involving *skeletal muscle fibers*
	- at **many synapses in the central nervous system**
	- at all **neuron‐to‐neuron synapses in the peripheral nervous system**
	- at all **neuromuscular and neuroglandular junctions** in the *parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system*
## Numbers and Dimensions of Cholinergic Synapses
- The ==synaptic cleft== (**distance between the pre‐ and post‐synaptic membranes**) is on the order of *20nm*
	- This is the distance that the **neurotransmitter must diffuse across**
	- *MORE SYNAPSES, MORE DELAY*
- The vast majority of acetylcholine is **packaged in synaptic vesicles**; *the contents of these vesicle are released into the synaptic cleft during communication*
- Each ==synaptic vesicle== can contain *thousands of acetylcholine*
- Each ==axon terminal== contains around *1 million vesicles*
## Events at a Cholinergic Synapse
1. An [[Action Potential]] **Arrives and Depolarizes** the ==Axon Terminal==
	- This follows a similar process as to what was discussed in Lecture 6, with the *influx of sodium to increase the membrane potential of the axon terminal*
	- In most synapses this the normal stimulus to induce the release of [[neurotransmitters]] into the synaptic cleft
2. **Extracellular Calcium Ions Enter the Axon Terminal**, *Triggering the Exocytosis of Acetylcholine*
	- Depolarization opens voltage‐gated calcium channels, allowing calcium ions to rush into the axon terminal
	- ==Calcium is necessary for synaptic vesicle exocytosis processes==
	- ACh is released in bundles of ~3000 molecules and the release is ceased very quickly after it starts (calcium is actively pumped out of the cytosol)

___
3. ==Acetylcholine== **Binds to Receptors and Depolarizes the Postsynaptic Membrane**
	- ACh diffuses across the [[synaptic cleft]] and *interacts with chemically gated cation channels*
	- This increases the *post‐synaptic membrane permeability* towards sodium and sodium rushes into the post‐synaptic cell
		- Note that potassium exits through these channels, but the electrochemical gradient is much stronger for sodium influx than potassium efflux
	- If this depolarization can bring an adjacent area of membrane to threshold, an action potential initiates (more ACh can help, but the time of ACh activity (~20msec) is tightly regulated)
4. ACh is Removed by Acetylcholinesterase (AChE)
	- The synaptic cleft contains many AChE enzymes, in fact ~ half of the released ACh is cleaved by AChE prior to reaching the post‐synaptic membrane
	- ACh is broken into acetate and choline
		-  Acetate diffuses away and is metabolized in the post‐synaptic cell or other nearby cells
		- Choline is actively absorbed by the pre‐synaptic cell and is used to produce more ACh

___
## Synaptic Delay and Synaptic Fatigue
- There is a delay of approximately 0.2 – 0.5msec between the arrival of the action potential at the axon terminal and the effect on the postsynaptic membrane
	- The majority of this delay is associated with the influx of calcium and the exocytosis of acetylcholin
	- As a comparison, in 0.5msec an action potential can travel ~7cm (the synaptic cleft is 20nm, this is a factor of 3.5 million)
	- This delay is additive with multiple neurons, thus suggesting the importance of reflexes
- In some instances, the firing of a neuron may exceed the production of ACh, since it is partially dependent on the recycling of Ach
	- When this happens the synapse weakens and may not be able to transmit as effectively
## Excitable Cells
- Unlike other cells, cells that are excitable contain voltage-gated ion channels, which respond to changes in the membrane potential
- Upon threshold, a significant portion of the voltage-gated sodium channels open, causing an action potential
	-  A typical neuron has a resting potential in the range of ‐70mV and the threshold is in the range of ‐60mV
		- Easier to excite (10mV difference)
	- A typical skeletal muscle cell has a resting potential in the range of ‐85mV and the threshold is in the range of ‐55mV
		- Harder to excite (30mV difference)
## Excitation-Contraction Coupling
- This specifically refers to the **link between changes in the muscle cell membrane potential** (induced by a neuron) and **the contraction of the muscle**
- This coupling occurs at the ==triads==, which was discussed in Lecture 3
- An [[action potential]] within the **triad** induces the release of calcium from the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]]
	- This occurs through *specialized receptors on both the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the sarcolemma*
	- The release of calcium occurs for ~30msec and increases the concentration of calcium within the cytosol by ~100 times
-  Recall that the triad is located in very close proximity to the zone of overlap of actin/myosin
## Molecular Actions of Calcium
- The **calcium interacts with troponin C**
	- Recall that *troponin is also bound to actin and tropomyosin*
- ==Binding of calcium==, **weakens the bond between actin and troponin and also causes a conformation change of troponin causing it to roll**
- ==The rolling action== *pulls tropomyosin off of the myosin active site on actin* –thus the active site is now exposed
- This can initiate the contraction cycle via cross‐bridge formation

## The Contraction Cycle
- The contraction cycle is a series of molecular events that enables muscle contraction
- The contraction cycle begins with the arrival of calcium ions within the zone of overlap
	- This leads to the exposure of the active-sites as detailed in the previous slides
- Under normal conditions, myosin heads are “charged” when the muscle is in a relaxed state
	-  Charged myosin heads have already hydrolyzed ATP into ADP and an inorganic phosphate
	- The ADP and inorganic phosphate are still associated with the myosin head and the head is cocked, pointing away from the M line
___
### Initiation of the Contraction Cycle
![[61D21FDD-490A-4307-9509-83DC90CD3A50.jpeg]]
- Once the active sites are exposed, energized myosin heads bind to the active sites present on actin
	- This forms a “cross-bridge”
	- This is accomplished through a bending of the myosin tails and not the myosin heads
- After the cross-bridge formation occurs (e.g. actin and myosin bind), the energy stored in the head of myosin from the hydrolysis of ATP is released
	- All of these molecular events induces a pivoting of the myosin head towards the M line
	- This is termed the power stroke and this is when ADP and phosphate are released
___
### Power Stroke Illustration
![[A1358FBA-08EC-4343-8C22-C253AE4A2C1E.jpeg]]
- After the power stroke occurs and ADP and phosphate are released, the myosin ATPase is available to bind to another ATP
	- Binding of ATP causes detachment of the myosin head from actin
	- The active site is available to bind to another myosin
	- During rigor, calcium has leaked into the cytosol, but there is a shortage of ATP, hence myosin stays bound to actin
- Myosin reactivates when the myosin head hydrolyzes the bound ATP into ADP and phosphate
	- If calcium is still present and bound to troponin, a second power stroke can occur
___

___
## Details Regarding the Contraction Cycle
- Each power stroke can **shorten the sarcomere by about 0.5%** or about $0.01 \mu m$
- Remember the each muscle is ==composed of many parallel sarcomeres== that each *shorten by $0.01 \mu m$ per power stroke*
- The speed of shortening depends on the **neutral input and the type of muscle**
	- The greater the load, the longer the shortening cycle
- Tug-of-war analogy: if you played by pulling, letting go, grabbing and pulling again, *you would be the myosin and the rope would be the actin*
	- Tension is dependent on how many teammates are pulling at an instant
	- You better hope that everyone cycles at different times, otherwise you let go and lose
## Shortening
- It is possible for both ends of the muscle to move towards each other, but this is rare since one end is normally fixed
- It is more likely that one end moves towards the other
- It is possible that neither end moves, this is isometric contraction
![[1942DD83-78A4-4609-8E48-21667F33160B.jpeg]]
## Relaxation
- The length of time that a contraction occurs depends on
	- **The period of stimulation** at the [[neuromuscular junction]]
	- The presence of **free calcium in the cytosol**
	- The availability of [[ATP]]
- You must have *multiple action potentials* to maintain a contraction due to ==AChE==
- Also, calcium us *quickly reabsorbed into the sarcoplasmic reticulum*
	- Multiple signals to release calcium are needed
## Length-Tension Relationship
- This provides a measure of *how effective a contraction will be*
- As the length increases or decreases the tension that can be developed decreases
	- A: Optimal length
	- B: Not enough overlap for max tension
	- C: Thin filaments pass the M line and internet with each other
	- D: Thick filaments hit the Z line
