# Mutations of one or a few nuc leotides can affect protein structure and function
---
- Small-scale [[Mutations|mutations]] include [[Point Mutations|point mutations]], **changes in one DNA nucleotide pair, which may lead to production of nonfunctional proteins**. 
	- If a [[Point Mutations|point mutation]] occurs in a [[Gametes|gamete]] or in a cell that gives rise to one, it *may be transmitted to offspring and to future generations*
		- Adverse mutations are called *genetic disorders* or *hereditary diseases*
- [[Nucleotide-pair substitutions]] can cause [[missense]] or [[nonsense mutations]]. 
	-  *A change in a nucleotide pair* may **transform one codon into another that is translated into the same amino acid**.
		- This is called a [[silent mutation]]

- Nucleotide-pair [[insertions]] or [[Deletion|deletions]] may produce [[Frameshift Mutations|frameshift mutations]].

---
- *Spontaneous mutations* can occur during **DNA replication**, **recombination**, or **repair**. 
- *Chemical and physical* [[mutagens]] cause **DNA damage that can alter genes**.
---
- Ever since biologists have understood how d*isease-causing proteins were the result of mutations in genes*, they have sought techniques for [[gene editing]]
- The [[CRISPR-Cas9 system]] is a **powerful new gene-editing technique** with the *potential to correct genetic mutations that cause disease*. 
- Significant technical and ethical questions have been raised about how this could or should be used.
