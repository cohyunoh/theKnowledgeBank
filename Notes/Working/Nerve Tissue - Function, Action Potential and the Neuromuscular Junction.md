# Nerve Tissue - Function, Action Potential and the Neuromuscular Junction
___
## Neurons are Nerve Cells
- These are specialized cells for intercellular communication
- The most common neuron in the central nervous system is the [[multipolar neuron]]
## Synapse

^e22433

- Each axon terminal is part of a synapse; the location where one cell communicates with another cell
- ==Presynaptic cell:== *sends the signal* and includes the **axon terminal**
- ==Postsynaptic cell:== *receives the message*
- ==Synaptic cleft:== a small space that separates the two cells
- It is most common for the **presynaptic cell** to release [[neurotransmitters]] at the **synaptic cleft**
- These [[neurotransmitters]] elicit some response from the postsynaptic cell
- Synapse between a neuron and muscle cell is termed the **neuromuscular junction**
## Myelin Sheath 

^61f6df

- A **specialized cell membrane** that *surrounds the axon of neurons*
	- ==Central Nervous System==: this membrane is provided by [[oligodendrocytes]]
	- ==Peripheral Nervous System==: this membrane is provided by [[Schwann cells]]
- [[Schwann cells]] can *only cover a small portion of a signal [[axon]]*, whereas [[oligodendrocytes]] can *cover larger sections and multiple axons*
	- A series of [[Schwann cells]] are needed to **completely cover an axon**
- *Not all neurons in the central nervous system are myelinated* and **make-up gray matter**; ==white matter is myelinated neurons in the central nervous system==
- Most [[neuron]]s in the **peripheral nervous system** are ==myelinated==
- **Myelin helps to increase the speed of communication**, which is a function of the membrane potential

## Membrane Potential
- The cell membrane acts as a **capacitor**, *this charge can be “stored” on the leaflets of the cell membrane*
- A potential forms because:
	- The **ionic composition of the extracellular fluid** and the **intracellular fluid** ==differ== (ECF has high sodium and chloride; the ICF has high potassium and proteins)
	- Cell are selectivity permeable and can regulate that selectivity (ions can only cross the cell membrane through specific channels)
		- Leak channels exist, otherwise channels open in response to specific stimuli
	- Membrane permeability is different for different ions and it is transient (this is a function of the channels that are present and their activities)
		- A sodium leak channel does not have the same permeability towards sodium as a potassium leak channel has to potassium
## Forces Involved in Membrane Potential 
- Membrane potential depends on contents of ECF and ICF
- The concentration gradient for each ion (**chemical gradient**)
- The movement of ions establishes a current and difference in charge on opposite sides of the membrane(**electrical gradient**)
- *Combined these forces are termed the electrochemical gradient*
- Resting potential typically in the range of ==-70mV==
![[37A56B67-723D-40FC-958E-9DDD9DE1E2B2.jpeg]]
## Equilibrium Potential
- The equilibrium potential is the membrane potential at which a particular ion experiences no net driving force 
	- (e.g. the concentration gradient is equal and opposite to the electrical gradient)
- For an average cell the equilibrium potential for:
	- Potassium is~-90mV
	- Sodium is~+60mV
- Chlorine and all other ions have their own equilibrium potential, the balance of which based on the concentration gradient and the permeabilities) establishes a membrane potential
![[BB0637F0-E41F-4AB4-A5F5-1180813338F2.jpeg]]
## Sodium - Potassium ATPase
- This is an active force that alters the membrane potential
- The sodium - potassium ATPase continually "bails" sodium out of the cell and potassium out of the intercellular fluid
	- Three sodium ions out; two potassium in in exchange for the energy obtained by hydrolyzing ATP
- This pump helps to maintain the membrane potential by maintaining the concentration gradients
- Note that what was discussed before were passive mechanisms (e.g. channels)
## Changes to the Membrane Potential
- ==Passive Channels==
	- Leak channels, which are always open, however the permeability through the channels can change based on changes to the channel structure
- ==Gated (or Active) Channels==: can be open, closed or inactive
	- Chemically gated, which require the association of a chemical with the protein that makes up the channel to open (ATPase can be included here)
	- Voltage gated, which requires a change in the membrane potential to open, this change alters the organization of the protein that forms the channel
	- Mechanically gated, which requires a mechanical force to open the channel
![[8ECB7B29-9361-480F-96CC-FB2F20A8A9A9.jpeg]]
## Action Potentials
-  Action potentials are propagated changes in the membrane potential
	- This is how nerves can send signals!
- Sodium ions enter the cell, which raises the membrane potential and causes the opening of other sodium channels (positive feedback mechanism, through a voltage‐gated mechanism)
- There is a threshold for this occur; typically occurs within the range of ‐55mV
	- A depolarization of ‐55mV will cause a propagated action potential
	- A depolarization of ‐60mV will probably not cause a propagated action potential
	- Termed all‐or‐none principle
## All-or-None Principle
- Like flushing a toilet
	- Once you push the handle, a given amount of water leaves and enters the toilet bowl
	- It does not matter how hard or fast you pulled the handle
	- Also, until the toilet fills a gain, you cannot flush a second time
- Membrane potential
	- Once threshold is met, a given depolarization occurs
	- It does not matter how the threshold is met
	- Until the ion channels go back to their resting states, a second action potential will not occur

## Generation of an Action Potential
1. Depolarization to Threshold: A significant influx of sodium that causes the voltage-gated sodium channels to open
2. Rapid Depolarization: Sodium channels open, membrane potential increases to approximately 30mV
3. Inactivation of Sodium Channels and Activation of Potassium Channels: Sodium channels close and cannot be reopened, potassium channel open, to bring the membrane potential back towards the resting potential
4. Closing of Potassium Channels: Currents cease and the Na-K ATPase resets the concentration gradients and thus the resting potential

## Continuous vs. Saltatory Propagation
- Continuous propagation is when every section of the membrane depolarizes
	- Caused by the flow of local currents to neighboring sections of the membrane
- Saltatory propagation is when the action potential skips myelinated sections of the membrane
	- Local currents flow through the axon and cannot leave through the myelinated sections
	- Myelinated sections increase the resistance to ion flow in the transverse direction as compared with the longitudinal direction
- Saltatory propagation occurs faster than continuous propagation
- Inactivation of sodium causes the action potential to move in one direction
### Schematic of Continuous vs. Saltatory Propagation

- Continuous slow
- Saltatory quick
## Axon Diameter Alerts Fiber Resistance
- Like an electrical cable, the larger the diameter of the cable, the less resistance it provides to flow
- Different types of axons
	- Type A fibers: large myelinated fibers, diameters in the range of 4‐20$\mu$m, carry action potentials up to a speed of 120 m/s (268mph)
	- Type B fibers: small myelinated fibers, diameters in the range of 2‐4$\mu$m, carry action potentials at an average speed of 18 m/s (40mph)
	- Type C fibers: unmyelinated fibers, diameters less than 2$\mu$m, carry action potentials at an average speed of 1 m/s (2mph)
## General Properties of a Synapse

^8a51eb

- Information always passes from the pre‐synaptic cell to the post‐ synaptic cell
- Synapses can be electrical or chemical
	- ==Electrical synapses== are when there is a **direct coupling of the pre‐ and post‐ synaptic cell** via *gap junctions* – these are fairly rare
		- **Changes in one cell causes changes in the second cell**, because the cytoplasm are directly coupled at these junctions
	- ==Chemical synapses== are when there is an **indirect coupling of the pre‐ and post‐synaptic cell**
		- An [[action potential]] causes the *release of a chemical from the pre‐synaptic cell into the synapse, the chemical may or may not interact with the post‐synaptic cell, possibly causing some information transfer*
## Chemical Synapse
- This provides a one-directional movement of information
- This also provides a much more specific interaction that can be regulated by various mechanisms
- Excitatory synapses and inhibitory synapses exist for various purposes
- We will discuss excitatory cholinergic synapse (which is most prevalent at the neuromuscular junction)
## Types of Neuron
![[2A70FE2E-844B-43B9-9635-61CD1ED0203A.jpeg]]
**Multipolar is most important**
## Types of Neuro-Active Molecules
- ==Neurotransmitters==: **directly causes a change in the membrane potential** through either a *chemically gated ion channel* (acetylcholine) or a *G‐protein linked channel that opens the chemically gated ion channel* (norepinephrine)
	- Some can act indirectly by diffusing across the cell membrane (nitric oxide)
- ==Neuromodulators==: **change the rate of neurotransmitter release** by the *pre‐synaptic cell or change the response of the post‐synaptic cell to the released neurotransmitter*
	- e.g. endorphins – control pain or substance P – regulation of the pituitary gland, in general the effects are poorly understood
