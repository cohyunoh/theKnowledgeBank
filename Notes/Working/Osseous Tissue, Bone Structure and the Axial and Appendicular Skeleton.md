# Osseous Tissue, Bone Structure and the Axial and Appendicular Skeleton
___
## Primary Functions of the Skeletal System
1. ==Support:== **Structural support for the entire body** is provided by the *skeletal system*, by providing a framework for which soft organs can attach to
2. ==Storage of Minerals and Lipids:== Calcium and phosphate (among other minerals) are stored in bone  and can be released as needed; *lipids are stored in the yellow bone marrow*
3. ==Blood Cell Production:== **Red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets** are *produced in the red bone marrow*; this is found in many hollow cavities in bone
4. ==Protection:== protects soft tissues/organs from mechanical forces (e.g. the skill protects the brain)
5. ==Leverage:== bones can function as levers that alter the magnitude and direction of forces generated by muscles
- Note: the [[skeletal system]] includes bones, cartilage, ligaments, and other connective tissues
## Bone Classification
- Bones are typically classified based on  their overall shape and structure 
- There are 206 bones in the adult skeleton, which are classified into 6 broad categories based on their shaoe
1. ==Long bones:== elongated, consisting of a shaft and two wider ends
2. ==Flat bones:== have a thin flattened shape
3. ==Sutural (Wormian) bones:== small, flat, irregularly shaped, between flat bones of the skull
4. ==Irregular bones:== have complex shapes, catch‐all
5. ==Short bones:== small and boxy with approximate equal dimensions
6. ==Sesamoid bones:== small, flat and shaped like a sesame seed
### Locations of Different Types of Bones

## Long Bone Structure
- ==Diaphysis:== Long tubular shaft, which contains a wall of compact bone that surrounds the marrow (or medullary) cavity 
- ==Epiphysis:== Expanded regions at the ends of the tubular shaft, consisting largely of spongy bone (cancellous/trabecular bone)
	- This type of bone resembles an open network of struts similar to latticework
	- The spongy bone of epiphysis is covered by a later of compact bone termed ==cortical bone==
- ==Metaphysis:== Transition region between the diaphysis and epiphysis

## Internal Organization of Bone
- Bone is considered a supporting connective tissue
- To be defined as connective tissue it needs to have specialized cells and a matrix consisting of extracellular protein fibers and a ground substance
- The matrix of bone is very dense and stiff containing deposits of calcium salts
- The matrix also contains bone cells (osteocytes)
- Osteoblasts, osteoclasts and osteoprogenitor cells are located on the surfaces of bone, not within the matrix
## Bone Matrix
- [[Calcium phosphate]] ($Ca_3(PO_4)_2$) comprises approximately **2/3 of the weight of bone**
- Calcium phosphate reacts with calcium hydroxide ($Ca(OH)_2$) to form hydroxyapatite crystals ($Ca_10(PO_4)6(OH)_2$)
	- As these crystals form, *they incorporate other calcium salts (e.g. calcium carbonate) and ions (e.g. sodium, fluoride)*
- [[Collagen]] comprises **approximately 1/3 of the weight of bone**
- Cells make up less than 2% of the weight of bone
- [[Calcium phosphate]] (like most ceramics) are very ==strong in compression==, but are *brittle and inflexible*
	- Calcium phosphate tends to shatter under tension, torsion, bending or high impulse impacts
- [[Collagen]], however, is ==very strong in tension, torsion and bending==, but *cannot withstand any compression*
- This mixture is similar to reinforced concrete
## Bone Cells
### Bone Cells - Osteocyte
- [[Osteocytes]] are the mature bone cells that make up the majority of the bone cell population
- A single osteocytes occupies a [[lacuna]]
- Osteocytes do not divide
- Narrow passageways, termed canaliculi, penetrate through the lamellae, connecting lacunae providing a communication pathway between osteocyte
	- Cytoplasmic extensions of osteocytes fill the canaliculi
- Osteocytes maintain the protein/mineral content of surrounding bone matrix and play a role in bone repair
### Bone Cells - Osteoblast
- Osteoblasts produce new bone matrix in a process termed ossification or osteogenesis
- The matrix that is produced by osteoblasts is not crystalized by calcium or other minerals upon release
	- At this point, the bone matrix is termed osteoid
- Osteoblasts release a significant amount of calcium, above its solubility limit, to help initiate calcium deposition within osteoid
- Osteoblasts differentiate into osteocytes if they become completely surrounded by bone matrix
### Bone Cells - Osteoprogenitor Cell
- Bone contains small numbers of these mesenchymal cells
- These cells differentiate into osteoblasts
- These cells play an important role in fracture healing responses
- These cells are found on all exterior surfaces of bone (e.g. facing the marrow cavity and the outer surface of a long bone)
### Bone Cells - Osteoclast
- Osteoclasts are cells that absorb and remove bone matrix
- Very large cells that are multinucleated
- These cells are more similar to macrophages than other bone cells
- Acids and proteolytic enzymes are secreted by these cells to dissolve the matrix and release the minerals found in bone matrix
	- This process is termed osteolysis (or resorption)
- In living bone, osteoblasts and osteoclasts are both active; the balance of these two processes determine if new bone is formed, old bone is removed or there is no net change

## Compact Bone Structure
- The functional unit of compact bone is the osteon (or Haversian canal system)
- Osteocytes are arranged in concentric circles surrounding a central canal, which contains blood vessels (normally a capillary and a small venule)
	- These lamellae form a bulls eye like pattern
- Perforating canals (Volkmann canals) are the passageways for blood vessels to enter the bone

## Spongy Bone Structure
- In [[spongy bone]], the lamellae are not arranged in the osteon structure
- Thin trabecular divide and converge in a seemingly “random” pattern
- Spongy bone is typically found where stresses arise from multiple directions
- The role of spongy bony is to reorient those stresses to a more uniform direction (compact bone handles the stresses in a more uniform direction)
- Red bone marrow is found between trabeculae of long bones; some spongy bone may contain yellow bone marrow
### Compact Bone vs. Spongy Bone Cartoon

## Distribution of Forces on a Long Bone
- The epiphysis (which is composed of spongy bone) transfer forces from many directions to the diaphysis
- The compact bone must withstand both tensile and compressive forces if the load is off-center
	- Assuming a non-rigid body
- Wolff’s law tries to quantify the loading condition on bone and remodeling of the bone (e.g. a tennis player will have different bone mechanical properties in their playing arm vs. their non-playing arm)

## Axial Skeleton
- The axial skeleton is composed of 80 bones
	- Skull (8 cranial bones + 14 facial bones)
	- Associated with the skull bones (6 auditory bones + the hyoid bone) 
	- Vertebral column (24 vertebrae + sacrum + coccyx)
	- Thoracic cage (24 ribs + sternum)
- Protects the brain, spinal cord and thoracic/abdominal organs
- Extensive surface for muscle attachment
- Helps with respiration
- Stabilize the appendicular skeleton

## Vertebrae
-  7 cervical vertebrae (compose the neck)
	- The atlas (C1) holds up the head and axis (C2) which provides a pivot for the head
- 12 thoracic vertebrae (articulates with the ribs)
- 5 lumbar vertebrae (strength and articulates with the sacrum)
	- Largest of the vertebrae, withstand a significant portion of the weight
- Sacrum, composed of 5 fused sacral vertebrae – they begin to fuse after puberty
	- Protects reproductive, digestive and urinary organs
- Coccyx, composed of ~4 fused coccygeal vertebrae – they begin to fuse around the age of 25
	- Attachment site for multiple muscles/ligaments
