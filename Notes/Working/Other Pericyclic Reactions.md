## The Importance of Symmetry

- This **is allowed** as the [[HOMO]] of the **butadiene** *matches the symmetry* of the [[LUMO]] of the **ethene** and the relationship is the same between the *HOMO of the ethene and the LUMO of the butadiene*.

- This is an example of how symmetry is all that matters
- **REMEMBER HOW THIS WORKS**
	- Looks like a test problem to me

## How to get around Symmetry
- Answer: [[Electrocyclic Reactions]]

- Use **light** to *excite an electron* to change the [[HOMO]] of one of the alkenes shown.
 ## Regiochemistry of Electrocyclic Reaction

- You want the best overlap of the orbitals.
	- The two biggest coefficients, denoted by the big green circles in each compound, should line up
- That is why **A** is right
