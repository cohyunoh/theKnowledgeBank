# Probability Laws Govern Mendelian Inheritance
---
- The [[Multiplication Rule|multiplication rule]] states that **the probability of two or more events occurring together** (a statement using **and**) is *equal to the product of the individual probabilities of the independent single events.* 
- The [[Addition Rule|addition rule]] states that **the probability of an event that can occur in two or more independent, mutually exclusive ways** (using **or**) is *the sum of the individual probabilities.*
- The **rules of probability** can be used *to solve complex genetics problems*. 
	- A [[Dihybrids|dihybrid]] or other **multicharacter cross** is *equivalent to two or more independent monohybrid crosses occurring simultaneously.*

	- In **calculating the chances of the various offspring** [[Genotypes|genotypes]] from such crosses, *each character is first considered separately* and then *the individual probabilities are multiplied.*
