# Prometaphase
---
The *second stage* of [[Mitosis|mitosis]] where the [[Nuclear Envelope|nuclear envelope]] **fragments** and the [[Mitotic Spindle|spindle microtubules]] attach to the [[Kinetochores|kinetchores]] of the [[Chromosomes|chromosomes]].

The [[Kinetochores|kinetochores]] are formed in this phase on the [[Centromeres|centromeres]] of the [[Sister Chromatids|sister chromatids]].

The *microtubules that connect to the kinetochores* are now **kinetochore microtubules** and they *jerk the chromosomes back and forth*.

The **nonkinetochore microtubules** help *lengthen* the cell.
