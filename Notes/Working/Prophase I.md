# Prophase I
---
- Each [[Chromosomes|chromosome]] *pairs with its* [[Homologs|homologs]], aligned **gene by gene** and [[Crossing Over and Synapsis|crossing over]] occurs.
	- **Crossing over** is when the [[DNA]] molecules of nonsister chromatids are *broken by* [[Proteins|proteins]] and rejoined to each other. ^31f6a6
	- Each **homolog** has one or more *X-shaped regions* called [[Chiasmata|chiasmata]] where cross overs have occurred.
- [[Centrosomes|Centrosome movement]], [[Mitotic Spindle|spindle formation]] and the [[Nuclear Envelope|nuclear envelope]] **breaks down**.
- The [[Chromosomes|chromosomes]] condense progressively.
- **Microtubules** from one pole or the other *attach* to the [[Kinetochores|kinetochores]] at the [[Centromeres|centromere]] of the **homologs** as the *two kinetochores* of the sister chromatids of a homolog are *combined together by proteins*. The homologs are moved towards the [[Metaphase Plate|metaphase plate]].
