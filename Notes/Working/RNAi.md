# RNA interference(RNAi)
---
- **A mechanism for silencing the expression of specific genes**. 
- In RNAi, *double-stranded RNA molecules that match the sequence of a particular gene are processed into [[siRNA]]* that either ==block [[Translation|translation]]== or ==trigger the degradation of the geneâ€™s [[mRNA|messenger RNA]]==. 
- This happens naturally in some cells and can be carried out in laboratory experiments as well.
