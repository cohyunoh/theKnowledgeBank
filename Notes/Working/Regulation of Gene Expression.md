# Regulation of Gene Expression
---
[[Bacteria often respond to environmental change by regulating transcription]]
[[Eukaryotic gene expression is regulated at many stages]]
[[Noncoding RNAs play multiple roles in controlling gene expression]]
[[A program of differential gene expression leads to the different cell types in a multicellular organism]]
[[Cancer results from genetic changes that affect cell cycle control]]
