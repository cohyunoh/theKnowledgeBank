# Sex-linked Genes Exhibit Unique Patterns of Inheritance
---
## The Chromosomal Basis of Sex
- **Sex** in many species is *determined largely by inheritance of* [[Sex chromosomes|sex chromosomes]].
- The **Y chromosome** is *much smaller* than the **X chromosome**.
- Females usually have *two X chromosomes*.
- Males usually have *one X chromosome and one Y chromosome*.
- **Short segments** on *either end of the Y chromosome* are the only regions **homologous** with regions on the X chromosome.
	- These **regions** allow the X and Y chromosome to *pair and behave* like [[Homologs|homologs]] during [[Meiosis|meiosis]] in testes.

**Some Chromosomal Systems of Sex Determination**
![[Pasted image 20211113184258.png]]

---
- In mammalian **testes and ovaries**, the two [[Sex chromosomes|sex chromosomes]] *segregate* during [[Meiosis|meiosis]].
	- Each egg *receives one X chromosome*.
	- **Half the sperm cells** *receive an X chromosome*.
	- **Other half of the sperm cells** *receive a Y chromosome*.
- You can now see how a fertilized egg gets either an *XX* [[Zygote|zygote]] or an *XY*[[Zygote|zygote]].
- A [[Genes|gene]] on the **Y chromosome**, *called SRY (sex-determining region of Y)*, is required for the *development of testes*.
	- This is how we can *determine sex* of an **embryo** 2 months in when the *rudiments of the gonads* are **generic**.
- A [[Genes|gene]] *located on either* [[Sex chromosomes|sex chromosome]] is called a [[Sex-Linked Genes|sex-linked gene]].
	- The human **X chromosome** contains approximately *1,100 genes*, which are called **X-linked genes**.
	- [[Genes]] located on the **Y chromosome** are called *Y-linked genes*.
		- 78 genes have been identified that code for about 25 proteins.
		- Very few disorders are passed through this chromosome
- The development of **female gonads** in humans requires a [[Genes|gene]] called *WNT4* located on *chromosome 1*, an [[Autosomes|autosome]].
	- *Encodes a protein that promotes ovary development*.
	- An **embryo with XY zygote** but has extra copies of *WNT4* gene can *develop rudimentary female gonads*.
- Overall, **sex** is *determined by the interactions of a network of gene products like these.*
## Inheritance of X-Linked Genes
- The fact that **males and females inherit a different number of X chromosomes** leads to a *pattern of inheritance different* from that *produced by genes located on* [[Autosomes|autosomes]].
- **X chromosomes** have numerous [[Genes|genes]] for [[Character (Biology)|characters]] *unrelated to sex*.
- **X-linked genes** in humans follow the *same pattern of inheritance* that Morgan observed for the **eye color locus** he studied in **fruit flies**.
	- Fathers pass **X-linked genes** to *all of their daughters*, but *none of their sons*.
	- Mothers can pass **X-linked alleles** to *both sons and daughters*.

**The Transmission of X-linked Recessive Traits**
![[Pasted image 20211113192801.png]]

---
- If an **X-linked trait** is due to a *recessive allele*, a **female** will *express the* [[Phenotypes|phenotype]] *only if she is* [[Homozygous|homozygous]] *for that allele*.
- Because males have only **one locus**, the terms [[Homozygous|homozygous]] and [[Heterozygous|heterozygous]] lack meaning for *describing their X-linked genes*; the term **hemizygous** is used.
	- Any male *receiving the recessive allele from his mother* will **express the trait**.
	- This is why **far more males** have *X-linked recessive disorders*.
		- [[Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy]] affects about **one out of 5,000 males** in the U.S.
		- [[Hemophilia]]
## X Inactivation in Female Mammals
- Almost **all of one X chromosome** in each cell in **female mammals** becomes *inactivated during early embryonic development*.
	- As a result, the **cells of females and males** have the *same effective dose* (==one active copy==) of most X-linked genes.
- The **inactive X** in each cell of a female *condenses into a compact object* called a [[Barr Body|Barr body]].
	- Most of the genes of the **X chromosome** that forms the [[Barr Body|Barr body]] are *not expressed*.
	- In the ovaries, however, [[Barr Body|Barr body]] chromosomes are *reactivated in the cells* that give rise to eggs, resulting in *every female gamete having an* **active X** after [[Meiosis|meiosis]].

**X Inactivation and the Tortoisehsell Cat**
![[Pasted image 20211113202600.png]]

---
- **Inactivate of an X chromosome** involves *modification of the* [[DNA]] and proteins bound to it called histones.
	- This includes the attachment of methyl groups to [[Nucleotides|DNA nucleotides]].
- A **particular region of each X chromosome** contains several genes *involved in the inactivation process*.
- **XIST (X-inactive Specific Transcript)** gene becomes active *only on the chromosome* that will become the [[Barr Body|Barr body]].
- Multiple copies of the **RNA product** of this [[Genes|gene]] apparently attach to the **X chromosome** on which they are made, *eventually almost covering it*.
	- This interaction *initiates X inactivation*, and the RNA products of nearby genes **help to regulate the process**.
