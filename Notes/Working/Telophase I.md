# Telophase I
---
- When this phase begins, each *half of the cell* has a **complete haploid set of duplicated chromosomes**.
- Each [[Chromosomes|chromosome]] is composed of **two** [[Sister Chromatids|sister chromatods]]; *one or both chromatids* have **regions of nonsister chromatid DNA**.
- [[Cytokinesis]] then takes place.
- [[Cleavage|cleavage furrow]] forms
- In some species, chromosomes **decondense** and the [[Nuclear Envelope|nuclear envelope]] reforms.
- *NO CHROMOSOME DUPLICATION* occurs between [[Meiosis I]] and [[Meiosis II]].
