The *fifth and final stage* of [[Mitosis|mitosis]], in which **daughter nuclei** are forming and [[Cytokinesis|cytokinesis]] has typically begun.

[[Nuclear Envelope|Nuclear evelopes]] are formed from the fragments of the *parent cell* for the two new **daughter cells**.

The [[Nucleolus|nuceoli]] reappear.

Any remaining **spindle microtubules** are *depolymerized*.

[[Mitosis]] is now complete.
