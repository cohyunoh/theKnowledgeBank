- This is within the [[Plasma Membrane|plasma membrane]]
- Can *clog up arteries*
- Body has **35 grams** of cholesterol
	- 0.25g from a normal diet per day
	- body generates 1g a day
- Body does this through [[Biosynthesis|biosynthesis]].

## The Biosynthesis of Cholesterol
- Requires [[DMAPP]]
### Process
1. Isomerize [[DMAPP]] into **IPP** (*isopentenyl pyrophosphate*).
	- ![[Pasted image 20211128204938.png]]
	- *DMAPP is more stable* so this **isomerization** requires an [[Enzymes|enzyme]].
		- The enzyme will *add a proton and then remove a proton* to **move a double bond**
		- It is call **IPP isomerase**
2. Ionize **OPP** and *make a cation from one of them* 
	- ![[Pasted image 20211128205916.png]]
	- The cation from [[DMAPP]] is *more stable*.
3. Attack cation with IPP and repeat the process

## Suggesting a Biosynthesis Pathway
![[Pasted image 20211128210327.png]]
- Hint: ==There is an intermediate called linalyl pyrophosphate LPP==
	- ![[Pasted image 20211128210543.png]]
	- We cannot rotate around double bonds
	- This one is almost allylic and has a single bond where need to rotate

- Chose the Neryl since we already have Z conformation
### Nature's Reagents for Biosynthesis
![[Pasted image 20211128211110.png]]
- Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide
- Can be used for the reduction of a ketone or the oxidation of an alcohol
