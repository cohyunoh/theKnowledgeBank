# The Eukaryotic Cell Cycle is Regulated by a Molecular Control System
- Signaling molecules in the **cytoplasm** help regulate *progress through the cell cycle*.
- In the [[cell cycle control system]], cyclic changes in **regulatory proteins**([[cyclins]] | [[cycling-dependent kinases (Cdks)]]) work like a cell cycle clock. 
	- At certain points on the clock, the *cell cycle will stop*, based on the cyclic changes, at specific *checkpoints* until they get a signal to go again. 
	- Important checkpoints are in the [[G1 Phase]], [[G2 Phase]], and Mitotic Phase.
	- *Internal and external* signals control the cell cycle checkpoints via signal transduction pathways.
	- Most cells exhibit [[density-dependent inhibition]] of cell division as well as [[anchorage dependence]]
- **Cancer cells** *avoid normal cell cycle regulation* and continually divide unchecked, *forming tumors*.
	- [[Malignant tumors]] invade nearby tissues and can undergo [[metastasis]] exporting cancer cells to other places which will form more tumors.
