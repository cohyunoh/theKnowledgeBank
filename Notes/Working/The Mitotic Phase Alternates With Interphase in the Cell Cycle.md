# The Mitotic Phase Alternates With Interphase in the Cell Cycle
- [[Cell Division]] is part of the [[Cell Cycle]](*an ordered sequence of events in the life of a cell*).
- In the [[Cell Cycle]], when the cell is *not dividing*, not in [[Mitosis]], then it is in [[Interphase]].
	- **Interphase** is made up of *three* subphases: [[G1 Phase]] | [[S Phase]] |  [[G2 Phase]]
	-  The **Mitotic Phase** is made up of: [[Mitosis]] | [[Cytokinesis]]

- The [[Mitotic Spindle]], made up of microtubules, controls how the chromosomes move during [[Mitosis]].
	- In animal cells, the **mitotic spindle**  comes from the [[Centrosomes]]. This includes *spindle microtubules and asters*.
	- Some of the spindles attach to the [[Kinetochores]] of chromosomes and move the chromosomes to the [[metaphase plate]].
	- These sister chromatids are separated via **motor proteins** in their kinetochores which move the chromatids along the kinetochore microtubules towards the ends of the cell.
	- The free microtubules elongate the cell as the motor proteins push them away as well
- After [[Mitosis]] is usually [[Cytokinesis]], which is carried out by [[Cleavage|cleavage]] in animal cells and plant cells just *form a cell plate*  as their cytokinesis. 
- [[Prokaryotes|Bacteria]] divides differently as they use [[Binary Fission|binary fission]] to replicate their chromosome and then *more actively* move the daughter chromosomes away from each other.
- Cell division in eukaryotes most likely *evolved* from from prokaryotic cell division.
	- Certain **unicellular eukaryotes** exhibit *mechanisms of cell divisions*, but not all of them and not even the same exact mechanisms, but similar. Could be the different iterations of the cell division through evolution.
