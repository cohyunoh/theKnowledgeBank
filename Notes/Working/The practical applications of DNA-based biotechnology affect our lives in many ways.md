# The practical applications of DNA-based biotechnology affect our lives in many ways
---
## Introduction
- [[Biotechnology]] has practical applications
## Medical Applications
- This deals with the *identification of human genes* whose [[Mutations|mutation]] plays a role in **genetic diseases**
	- These *discoveries* may lead to ways of ==diagnosing==, ==treating==, and even ==preventing== such conditions
### Diagnosis and Treatment of Diseases
- The use of ==[[PCR]]== and ==labeled [[nucleic acid probe]]s== to **track down pathogens** has opened a new chapter in the *diagnosis of infectious diseases*
	- [[RT-PCR]] is often the *best way to detect* an otherwise **elusive infectious agent**
- Medical scientists can now diagnose ==hundreds of human genetic disorders== by using [[PCR]] with *primers that target the genes associated with these disorders*
### Personal Genome Analysis
- [[genome-wide association studies|Genome-wide association studies]] have ==pinpointed [[SNP]]s== that are **linked to disease-associated alleles**
	- ==Individuals== can be tested by [[PCR]] and sequencing for a [[SNP]] that is *correlated* with the **abnormal allele**
- ==Direct-to-consumer [[Genome|genome]] analysis companies== offer **kits** allowing individuals to *send in a swab containing cheek cells that the company will analyze genetically*
	- This allows for people to know what [[SNP]]s they have and therefore **what health risks they have** based on *previously identified SNP linked diseases like heart disease, ALzheimer's disease, and some types of cancer*
- This is also how ==ancestry== is done as they **compare a person's DNA segments with those from reference populations around the world**
### Personalized Medicine
- Knowing the ==expression levels== of *particular genes in a given individual* can **help physicians determine the likelihood of cancer and its reappearance**
	- Helps them design more specific treatments
- This shows the future of [[personalized medicine]]
	- ==Sequencing== needs to become *inexpensive*
		- Could be done if we just sequence the [[Exons|exons]]
- Knowing the *genomic information* of an individual can be used to **predict the benefits and risk of particular medications** as well, ==pharmacogenetics==
### Human Gene Therapy and Gene Editing
- [[Gene therapy]] holds *great potential* for **treating the relatively small number of disorders traceable to a single defective gene**
	- The goal is to **insert a normal allele of the defective gene** into the [[Somatic Cells|somatic cells]] of the tissue affected by the disorder
- For [[Gene therapy|gene therapy]] of [[Somatic Cells|somatic cells]] to be ==permanent==, the *cells that receive the normal allele* must be **cells that multiply throughout the patient's life**
- ![[Pasted image 20211212185445.png]]
- The procedure shown above was *successful*, but resulted in **three patients developing leukemia**
	- The insertion of the [[retroviruses|retroviral]] [[cloning vector|vector]] *occurred near a gene that triggers the proliferation of blood cells*
- [[Gene therapy]] raises many technical issues
	- How can the *activity of the transferred gene* be ==controlled== so that **cells make appropriate amounts of the gene product at the right time and in the right place**?
	- How can we be sure that the ==insertion of the therapeutic gene== **does not harm some other necessary cell function**?
- *To avoid complications*, we can use [[gene editing]] in the form of the [[CRISPR-Cas9 system]]
	- In this approach, the *existing defective gene* is ==edited== to **correct the mutation**
- *Researchers, physicians, and patients* alike are excited about the ==potential of [[CRISPR-Cas9 system|CRISPR technology]]== to **treat or even cure human diseases that have a genetic basis**, such as *sickle-cell, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases, as well as some types of cancer*
- However, the *possible effects on genes that are not being targeted* are of concern
- [[Gene therapy]] and [[gene editing]] provoke **ethical questions**
	- Some think it unethical to tamper with human genes in any way
	- Some also take issue with engineering human germ-line cells to try to correct a defect in future generations, even though it is now being done routinely on mice
- The creators of the [[CRISPR-Cas9 system]] has voiced their concerns for **any experimental work on human eggs or embryos**
- There are many ==potential technical problems== with the [[CRISPR-Cas9 system]] as well as ethical considerations
## Pharmaceutical Products
### Synthesis of Small Molecules for Use as Drugs
- *Determining the sequence and structure of proteins* crucial for ==tumor cell survival== has led to the **identification of small molecules that combat certain cancers by blocking the function of these proteins**.
- ==Imatinib== is a *drug with a small molecule* that **inhibits one tyrosine kinase**
	- The **overexpression of this kinase**, resulting from [[Translocation|chromosomal translocation]], is instrumental in *causing chronic myelogenous leukemia*
- This approach is only feasible whose **molecular basis is fairly well understood**
- Cells will also arise that are **resistant to the new drug** so one drug will likely not be the ==miracle drug==
### Protein Production in Cell Cultures
- ==Pharmaceutical products== that are proteins are *commonly synthesized on a large scale* using **cell cultures**
- There are [[DNA cloning]] and [[Gene Expression|gene expression]] systems for **producing large quantities of  a chosen protein** that is *present naturally in only minute amounts*
- The ==host cells== used in such ==expression systems== can even *even be engineered to secrete a protein as it is made*, thereby simplifying the task of **purifying it by traditional biochemical methods**
- Among the first pharmaceutical products manufactured in this way were human insulin and human growth hormone (HGH).
### Protein Production by "Pharm" Animals
- Instead of using ==cell systems== to **produce large quantities of protein products**, pharmaceutical scientists can *use whole organisms*
	- To do this, they use a [[transgene]]
- They first **remove eggs from a female of the recipient species and fertilize them [[in vitro]]**
- Meanwhile, they **clone the desired gene from a donor organism**
- They then **inject the cloned DNA directly into the nuclei of the fertilized eggs**
- Some of the cells are able to **integrate the [[transgene]] into their [[Genome|genome]]** and can *express it*
- The engineered embryos that *arise from these zygotes* are then **surgically implanted in a surrogate female**
- Is successful in development, the result is a [[transgenic|transgenic organism]]
- These [[transgenic|transgenic organisms]] can act as ==pharmaceutical factories==
	- MILK CAN HAVE THE PROTEINS NEEDED TO TREAT CERTAIN CONDITIONS
## Forensic Evidence and Genetic Profiles
- In a crime scene, if *enough blood, semen, or tissue is available*, forensic laboratories can **determine the blood type or tissue type by using antibodies to detect specific cell-surface proteins**
	- This can only exclude a suspect as many people have the same blood or tissue type
- ==DNA testing==, can **identify the guilty individual** with a *high degree of certainty* because the DNA sequence of every person is **unique**
- ==Genetic markers== that vary in the population can be *analyzed* for a given person to d**etermine that individual’s unique set of genetic markers**, or [[genetic profile]]
	- The first method used [[gel electrophoresis]] and [[Nucleic acid hybridization|nucleic acid hybridization]] to **detect similarities and differences** in DNA samples.
	- Only needed 1,000 cells from either blood or tissue samples
- Today, forensic scientists use an even *more sensitive method* that takes advantage of **variations in length of genetic markers** called [[STRs|short tandem repeats (STRs)]].
- The *number of repeats present in these regions* is **highly variable from person to person (polymorphic)**
- [[PCR]] is used to *amplify particular [[STRs]]*, using ==sets of primers== that are labeled with colored fluorescent tags; the **length of the region, and this the number of repeats, can then be determined** by [[gel electrophoresis|electrophoresis]]
- This can also be used for paternity tests
## Environmental Cleanup
- Increasingly, the *diverse abilities of certain microorganisms to transform chemicals* are being **exploited** for ==environmental cleanup==
- For example, many bacteria **can extract heavy metals**, *such as copper, lead, and nickel*, **from their environments** and ==incorporate the metals into compounds== such as copper sulfate or lead sulfate, which are **readily recoverable**.
- ==Genetically engineered microorganisms== may become important in both **mining** (especially as *ore reserves are depleted*) and **cleaning up highly toxic mining wastes**.
## Agriculture Applications
- The **Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations** predicts that we will need *70% more food by the year 2050 than we are currently producing*.
- [[DNA technology]] is being used to **improve agricultural productivity and improved nutritional value of crops**.
- *The ability of scientists to produce [[transgenic]] plants* speeds up the ==selective breeding process==, as **beneficial genes can be transferred between varieties or species**.
- [[genetic engineering|Genetic engineering]] in plants has been used to **transfer many useful genes including those for resistance** to *insect pests, viral and fungal diseases, heat, cold, herbicides, salty or acidic soil, and drought*.
- The ==C4 Rice Project== aims to **alter a strain of rice to perform C4 photosynthesis instead of C3 photosynthesis**. 
	- This would *increase crop yield* **at the anticipated higher temperatures of the future**
## Safety and Ethical Questions Raised by DNA Technology
- *Potential benefits of genetic engineering* must be ==weighed== against **potential hazards of creating harmful products or procedures**
- ==Guidelines are in place== in the United States and other countries to **ensure safe practices for [[recombinant DNA molecule|recombinant]] [[DNA technology]]**
- Most public concern about possible hazards centers on [[GMOs|genetically modified (GM) organisms]] used as food
- Some are concerned about the creation of “==super weeds==” from the **transfer of genes from GM crops to their wild relatives**, *loss of biodiversity*, *allergies*, *cultural dietary practices*.
- National agencies and international organizations strive to set guidelines for safe and ethical practices in the use of biotechnology
