# Transcription is the DNA-directed synthesis of RNA
---
- **RNA synthesis** is *catalyzed* by [[RNA polymerase]], which *links together RNA nucleotides complementary to a DNA template strand*. 
- [[Transcription]] **follows the same base-pairing rules as DNA replication**, *except that in RNA, uracil (U) substitutes for thymine (T)*.

- The *three stages* of [[Transcription|transcription]] are [[Initiation|initiation]], [[Elongation|elongation]], and [[Termination|termination]]. 
- A [[Promoter|promoter]] sequence, often including a [[TATA box]] in eukaryotes, **establishes where RNA synthesis is initiated**. 
- There is also a [[Terminator|terminator]] **in bacteria**
	- the [[Promoter|promoter]] sequence in DNA is said to be **upstream** from the [[Terminator|terminator]].
- The *stretch of DNA downstream from the [[Promoter|promoter]] that is transcribed into an RNA molecule* is called a [[transcription unit]]

---
- The [[Promoter|promoter]] *sequence of a gene includes within it the transcription* [[Start Point|start point]].

- [[Transcription factors]] help *eukaryotic RNA polymerase* **recognize promoter sequences**, forming a [[Transcription Initiation Complex|transcription initiation complex]].
