# Viruses and Prions are Formidable Pathogens in Animals and Plants
---
## Viral Diseases in Animals
- *Symptoms of viral diseases* may be caused by **direct viral harm to cells** or by the **bodyâ€™s immune response**. 
- [[Vaccines]] *stimulate the immune system* to **defend the host against specific viruses**.
- Curing viruses is a different story
	- Only some drugs are able to **attack enzymes encoded by viruses**
		- Some shut down the viral polymerase
		- Others interfere with [[reverse transcriptase]]
	- Multidrug treatments called "cocktails" are considered the most effective.
##  Emerging Viral Diseases
- An [[epidemic]], a widespread outbreak of a disease, can become a [[pandemic]], a global epidemic.
- Causes of New Viruses
	- [[Mutations|Mutation]] of **existing viruses into new viruses** that can *spread more easily*.
		- ==RNA viruses== have a **high rate of mutation** because *viral RNA polymerases do not proofread and correct errors in replicating their RNA genomes.*
	- Small, isolated human population
	- Spread of existing viruses from other animals
		- COVID-19!!!
		- Most common way
- Outbreaks of emerging viral diseases in humans are usually not new, but rather are caused by existing viruses that expand their host territory. 
- The ==H1N1 2009 flu virus== was **a new combination of pig, human, and avian viral genes that caused a pandemic**. 
- The ==H5N1 avian flu virus== has the *potential to cause a high-mortality flu pandemic.*
- Worldwide global warming leads to more mosquitoes leading to the spread of more diseases
## Viral Diseases in Plants
- **Viruses enter plant cells through damaged cell walls** (==horizontal transmission==) or are **inherited from a parent** (==vertical transmission==).
## Prions: Proteins as Infectious Agents
- [[Prions]] are slow-acting, virtually indestructible infectious proteins that cause brain diseases in mammals.
	- They are **not destroyed or deactivated** by *heating to normal cooking temperatures*
