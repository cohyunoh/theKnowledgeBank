# Viruses replicate only in host cells
---
## Introduction
- [[Viruses]] lack *metabolic enzymes and equipment* for **making proteins, such as [[Ribosomes|ribosomes]]**
	- They can **only replicate within a host cell**
- Each particular virus can **infect cells** of only a *limited number of host species* called the [[host range]] of a virus
- This host **specificity results from the evolution of recognition systems by the virus**.
	- Viruses identify host cells via a **"handshake" fit** between *viral surface proteins and specific receptor molecules on the outside of cells*
## General Features of Viral Replicative Cycles
-  A **viral infection** begins when a [[Viruses|virus]] binds to a *host cell and the viral genome makes its way inside*
- The mechanism of how this happens depends on the **type of virus**
	- **T-even [[phages]]** use their *elaborate tail apparatus to inject DNA into a bacterium*
	- *Other viruses* are **taken up by endocytosis** or, in the case of [[viral envelope|enveloped viruses]], *by fusion of the  [[viral envelope]] with the host's plasma membrane*
- Once the virus has *infiltrated the cell*, it **uses the proteins it encodes to take control of the cell and begins copying itself**
	- The host provides the [[Nucleotides|nucleotides]] for making **viral nucleic acids**, as well as *enzymes, [[Ribosomes|ribosomes]], [[tRNA|tRNAs]], [[Amino Acids|amino acids]], ATP, and other components for making viral proteins*
- Difference between **DNA viruses** and **RNA viruses**:
	- DNA viruses use the [[DNA Polymerases]] of the host to **program new genomes along the templates provided by the viral DNA**
	- RNA viruses use **virally encoded [[RNA polymerase|RNA Polymerases]] to that can use [[RNA]] as a template**

- After the *viral nucleic acid molecules and capsomeres are produced*, they **spontaneously self-assemble into new viruses**
## Replicative Cycles of Phages
### The Lytic Cycle
- [[Lytic Cycle]]
- A [[phages|phage]] that *replicates only by a [[Lytic Cycle|lytic cycle]]* is a [[virtulent phage]].

### The Lysogenic Cycle
- Instead of *lysing their host cells*, many [[phages]] **coexist with them in a state of lysogeny**.
- The [[lysogenic cycle]] allows **replication of the [[phages|phage]] genome without destroying the host**
- [[phages|Phages]] capable of **using both modes of replicating within a bacterium** are called [[temperate phages]]
- Infection of an *E. coli cell* by *phage λ* follows this procedure
	1. [[phages|Phage]] **binds to surface of the cell** and **injects its linear DNA genome**
	2. *The λ DNA molecule* forms a circle
- Now we can go one of two ways:
	- [[Lytic Cycle]]
		1. *Viral genes* immediately **turn the host cell into a l-producing factory**
		2. The cell soon *lyses* and **releases its virus progeny** 
	- [[lysogenic cycle|Lysogenic Cycle]]
		1. The **λ DNA molecule** is *incorporated into a specific site on the E. coli chromosome* by viral proteins 
		2. The *viral proteins* **break both circular DNA molecules and join them to each other**
			- This creates a [[prophage]]
		3. One [[prophage]] gene **codes for a protein that prevents transcription of most of the other [[prophage]] genes**
			- The [[phages|phage]] [[Genome|genome]] is mostly within the bacterium
		4. Each division of the cell results each *daughter cell* **inheriting a [[prophage]]**

### Bacterial Defenses Against Phages
- *Natural selection favors bacteria* that **have surface proteins that are no longer recognized as receptors**
- When the *phage DNA does enter a bacterium*, the DNA often is **identified as foreign and cut up by cellular enzymes** called [[restriction enzymes]]
	- The bacteria's DNA is protected as it is methylated a certain way to avoid the [[restriction enzymes]]
- [[CRISPR-Cas9 system]] was discovered during a study of **repetitive DNA sequences present in the [[Genome|genomes]] of many [[Prokaryotes|prokaryotes]]**
	- These sequences were called ==CRISPRs (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)== because *each sequence reads the same forward and backward*, with **different stretches of "spacer DNA" in between the repeats**
	- Further studies revealed these "spacer DNA" are the result of **DNA from particular phage that had infected cell**
	- *Particular [[Nuclease|nuclease proteins]]* **interact with the CRISPR region** which can ==identify and cut phage DNA, thereby defending the bacterium against phage infection==
		- This is similar to white blood cells learning to kill the same viruses again

## Replicative Cycles of Animal Viruses
### Viral Envelopes
- An *animal virus* equipped with the an [[viral envelope|envelope]] **uses it to enter the host cell**
	- *Protruding from the outer surface of this envelope* are ==viral glycoproteins== that **bind to specific receptor molecules on the surface of a host cell**.
- [[Ribosomes]] bound to the [[Endoplasmic Reticulum]] of the **host cell make the protein parts** of the *envelope glycoproteins*
	- The [[viral envelope]] is *usually derived from the host cell's plasma membrane*

### Viral Genetic Material
- There are **three types of single-stranded RNA genomes found in animal viruses**
	- The [[Genome|genome]] of **class IV viruses** can *directly serve as [[mRNA]]* and *thus can be [[Translation|translated]] into viral protein immediately after infection.* 
- ==Class V viruses== the [[RNA]] genome **serves instead as template for [[mRNA]] synthesis**

- The *RNA animal viruses* with **the most complicated replicative cycles** are the [[retroviruses]]
	- These viruses have an enzyme called [[reverse transcriptase]] 
	- Two important [[retroviruses]]: [[HIV|HIV (human immunodeficiency syndrome)]] | [[AIDS|AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome)]]
	- [[HIV]] and other retroviruses are **enveloped viruses that contain two identical molecules of single-stranded RNA** and **two molecules of [[reverse transcriptase]]**.
- The ==HIV replicative cycle== is typical of a [[retroviruses|retrovirus]]
	1. After [[HIV]] enters the host, its [[reverse transcriptase]] molecules **are released into the [[Cytoplasm|cytoplasm]]** where they *catalyze the synthesis of viral DNA*.
	2. The *newly made viral DNA* then **enters the cell's nucleus** and **integrates into the DNA of a chromosome**
	3. The [[provirus]] **remains in the cell host**
	4. The [[RNA polymerase]] of the host **transcribes the proviral DNA into RNA molecules**, which can function both as *[[mRNA]] for the synthesis of viral proteins* and as *genomes for the new viruses that will be assembled and released from the cell*

## Evolution of Viruses
- Since viruses can replicate only within cells, they probably evolved after the first cells appeared, perhaps as packaged fragments of cellular nucleic acid.
