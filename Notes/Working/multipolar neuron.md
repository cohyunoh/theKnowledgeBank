# Multipolar Neuron 
___
- *A large cell body*: contains a large round nucleus, with typical organelles (mitochondria, ribosomes, cytoskeleton, but ==no centrioles==)
- *Several short, branched dendrites*: variable number of sensitive processes, which plan an important role in **intercellular communication** because they receive signals from other cells, **dendritic spines**
- *A single long axon*: designed to propagate an electrical impulse (or [[action potential]]) to locations far from the body cell
- *Terminal branches*: these are specialized locations that play a role in communicating with other cells

- ==Favorite region:== **Axon hillock**
	- If it experiences an [[action potential]], that [[action potential]] goes down the [[axon]]
- You also would want to send signal close to the **axon hillock** so there is no miscommunication
	- Think like telephone game
