# transfer RNA
---
- An [[RNA|RNA molecule]] that **functions as a translator between [[Nucleic Acids|nucleic acid]] and protein languages by picking up a specific amino acid and carrying it to the [[Ribosomes|ribosome]]**, where the t==RNA recognizes the appropriate codon in the mRNA==.
- Like mRNA and other types of cellular RNA, transfer RNA molecules are **[[Transcription|transcribed]] from DNA templates**
- In a [[Eukaryotes|eukaryotic cell]], [[tRNA]], like [[mRNA]], is **made in the nucleus and then travels to the cytoplasm**, where it will *participate in the process of [[Translation|translation]]*.
