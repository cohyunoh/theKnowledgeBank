# Asexual Reproduction
---
A **single individual** (like a yeast cell or an amoeba) is the **sole parent** and *passes copies of all its genes* to its offspring without the **fusion** of [[Gametes|gametes]].

This can give rise to a **clone**.

Example:
Single-celled [[Eukaryotes|eukaryotic organisms]] can reproduce **asexually** by [[Mitosis|mitotic]] [[Cell Division|cell division]]. The [[Genome|genomes]] of the offspring are *virtually exact copies* of the parent's [[Genome|genome]].
