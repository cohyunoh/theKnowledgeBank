# Bacteria often respond to environmental change by regulating transcription
---
## Introduction
- Regulation came from the *inherent evolutionary advantage* with bacteria being able to **conserve resources and energy**

- *Cells control metabolism* by **regulating enzyme activity or the expression of genes coding for enzymes**. 

---
## Operons: the Basic Concept
- A *key advantage of grouping genes of related function into one transcription unit* is that a **single “on-off switch” can control the whole cluster of functionally related genes**; in other words, these genes are ==coordinately controlled==.
- In bacteria, *genes are often clustered into [[operons]]*, with one [[Promoter|promoter]] serving several adjacent genes. 
- An [[operator]] site on the DNA **switches the [[operons|operon]] on or off**, resulting in ==coordinate regulation of the genes==.
	- *Positioned within the promoter* or, in some cases, between the promoter and the enzyme-coding genes, the [[operator]] **controls the access of [[RNA polymerase]] to the genes**.

## Repressible and Inducible Operons: Two Types of Negative Gene Regulation
---
- Both **repressible** and **inducible** [[operons]] are examples of *negative gene regulation*. 
- In either type of [[operons|operon]], *binding of a specific [[repressor]] protein to the operator shuts off transcription*. 
	- (The [[repressor]] is *encoded by a separate [[regulatory gene]]*.) 
- In a **repressible operon** (usually encoding anabolic enzymes), the [[repressor]] is active when bound to a [[corepressor]], often the end product of the pathway.

- In an **inducible operon** (usually encoding catabolic enzymes), *binding of an [[inducer]] to an innately active repressor* **inactivates the [[repressor]] and turns on transcription**.

## Positive Gene Regulation
---
- Some operons have *positive gene regulation* via a stimulatory [[activator]] protein (such as CRP, when activated by [[cyclic AMP]]), **binds to a site within the promoter and stimulates transcription**.
