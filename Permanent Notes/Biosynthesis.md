# Biosynthesis
---
- An **enzyme-catalyzed process** in *cells of living organisms* by which **substrates** are *converted to more complex products*.

- The ==biosynthesis process== often consists of **several enzymatic steps** in which the product of one step is used as a *substrate* in the following step.

- Examples for such **multi-step** biosynthesis pathways are those  for the production of [[Amino Acids|amino acids]], [[Fatty Acids|fatty acids]], [[Steroids|steroids]], and *other natural products*.
