# Cope and Claisen Rearrangements
---
## When are we set up for one of these arrangements

- **A** is better as it is more stable, but you can get **B** by heating it to *200 degrees Celsius*.
	- How?: [[Pericyclic Reactions|pericyclic reaction]].
## The Claisen Rearrangement
![[Pasted image 20211116011714.png]]
- The reaction mentioned before is called the [[Claisen Rearrangement|claisen rearrangement]].
- This is a form of a [[Pericyclic Reactions|pericyclic reaction]].
- It deals with the *cyclic electron flow* of **6 electrons**.
- It is also [[Concerted|concerted]].
- It has a **keto intermediate** that is *not stable*.
## The Cope Rearrangement

- Imagine a **3pi + 3pi** reaction
- The intermediate will have an *imaginary radical* in the middle
- It will then decide which side to reattach on

- This is a better way to think about it as we've seen a **4 pi + 2 pi** rearrangement with the [[Diels-Alder Reaction]].
## Summary of the Three (And Others)

- [[Decarboxylation]] is also a **pericyclic reaction**
	- ![[Pasted image 20211116012619.png]]
	- Even the other examples with [[Enes|enes]] are *pericyclic*
## How do you Recognize A Cope Reaction:
![[Pasted image 20211116012740.png]]
- You need **double bonds**
- Then *number the bonds*
	- It needs to be a **1-5 diene**
- Once cope done, *assess the stability*
	- Could more than one 1-5 diene
## Oxy-Cope

- The driving force is the **carbonyl formation**.
- ==DO NOT FORGET TO MAKE THE CARBONYL==
