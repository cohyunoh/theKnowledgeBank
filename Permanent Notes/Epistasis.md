# Epistasis
---
- In **epistasis**, the **phenotypic expression of a gene** at one [[Locus|locus]] alters that of a *gene at a second locus*.
- Labrador example
	- **Black coat color** is *dominant* to **brown**.
	- Let's designate *B* and *b* as the **two alleles**.
	- Brown fur [[Phenotypes|phenotype]] must come from *bb*
	- But wait, there's more:
		- A **second gene** determines *whether or not pigment will be deposited in the hair*.
		- *E*, the **dominant allele**, signifies the *deposition of the pigment*.
		- If *ee*, [[Homozygous|homozygous]] and [[Trait (Biology)#^cc96c8|recessive]], the coat is just **yellow**, *regardless of the genotype at the black/brown locus*.
