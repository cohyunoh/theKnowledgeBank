# Eukaryotic gene expression is regulated at many stages
---
## Introduction
---
- All organisms must regulate which genes are expressed at any given time.
- The **turning on and off of genes** happens in response to *signals from the external and internal environment*.
## Differential Gene Expression
---
- All cells have an identical [[Genome|genome]] and that means **they all have the same genes**.
- About 35% of the [[Genes|genes]] are *housekeeping genes* and are **expressed by many cell types**.
- What *differentiates cell types* is ~~not due to different genes~~ but due to [[differential gene expression]].
	- The function of any cell **depends on its expressing the appropriate set of genes**
	- [[Transcription factors]] of a cell must *locate the right genes at the right time* which is hard enough, but throw in **abnormal gene expression** and that can lead to ==serious imbalances and disease==.

### Stages in Gene Expression that can be Regulated in Eukaryotic Cells
![[Pasted image 20211207173839.png]]
1. An outer signal, *internal or external environmental signals*, contacts the [[Chromatin|chromatin]] and it **modifies and unpacks itself to show the uncompressed DNA strip**
2. A gene available for [[Transcription|transcription]] necessary to respond to the signal is **transcribed**
3. [[RNA processing]] occurs, [[Introns|Introns]] are *removed* and [[Exons|exons]] are *reattached to each other*
4. [[mRNA]] is created and **transported out of the nucleus** into the [[Cytoplasm|cytoplasm]]
5. [[Translation]] occurs, leading the the **degradation of mRNA** and a [[Polypeptides|polypeptide]] remains
6. The [[Polypeptides|polypeptide]] goes through **protein processing** to become an *active protein*
7. The cellular function is then done as the protein **degradates**

## Regulation of Chromatin Structure
- The *structural organization of [[Chromatin|chromatin]]* helps to **regulate gene expression in man ways**
### Histone Modifications and DNA Methylation
- *Chemical modifications to [[Histones|histones]]* play a direct role in the **regulation of gene [[Transcription|transcription]]**
- [[Histones]] have tails that are *accessible to various modifying enzymes* that **catalyze the addition or removal of specific chemical group**
	- Acetyl ($â€”COH_3$)
	- Methyl
	- Phosphate
- [[Histone Acetylation|Histone acetylation]] *appears to promote [[Transcription|transcription]]* by **opening up chromatin structure**, while the addition of methyl groups to histones can lead to the **[[Condensation (Chromatin)]] of chromatin and reduced transcription**.

- [[DNA Methylation]] occurs in most *plants, animals, and fungi*
- Long stretches of **inactive DNA** are generally *more methylated* than regions of **actively transcribed DNA**
- Once methylated, genes usually stay **inactive** through *successive cell divisions* in a given individual.
	- **Methylation patterns are passed onto daughter cells** through enzymes and is a *chemical record of what happened in embryonic development*
	- This maintaining of information also accounts for [[Genomic Imprinting]]
- [[DNA Methylation]] and [[Histone Acetylation]] are coordinated to **regulate the expression of either the maternal or paternal allele of particular genes at the start of a development**
### Epigenetic Inheritance
- **Inheritance of traits transmitted by mechanics not involving the nucleotide sequence itself** is called *[[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] inheritance*
- Modifications to [[Chromatin|chromatin]] **can be reversed**
	- They are also *changeable* and are *sensitive* to **environmental conditions**
	- Example: Same two mouse of same species was born but mothers were fed different diets

## Regulation of Transcription Initiation
### Organization of a Typical Eukaryotic Gene and its Transcript
- Associated with most [[Eukaryotes|eukaryotic]] genes are multiple [[control elements]]
	- [[control elements|Control elements]] on the DNA and [[Transcription factors|transcription factors]] that bind them together are **critical to the precise regulation of gene expression seen in different cell types**

## The Roles of General and Specific Transcription Factors
### General Transcription Factors at the Promoter
- To initiate [[Transcription|transcription]], *eukaryotic [[RNA polymerase]] II* **requires the assistance of [[Transcription factors|transcription factors]]**
- Some [[Transcription factors|transcription factors]] are essential for the [[Transcription|transcription]] of *all protein-coding genes* and are called **general transcription factors**
- Protein-protein interactions are crucial to the initiation of [[Eukaryotes|eukaryotic]] [[Transcription|transcription]] 
### Enhancers and Specific Transcription Factors
- The more *distal control elements*, groupings of which are called [[enhancers]], may be thousands of [[Nucleotides|nucleotides]] **upstream or downstream** of a gene or even within an [[Introns|intron]]
- A given gene may have multiple [[enhancers]], *each active at a different time, cell type, or location* in the organism
- In [[Eukaryotes|eukaryotes]], the *rate of gene expression can be strongly increased or decreased* by **the binding of specifics transcriptions factors, either [[activator|activators]] or [[repressor|repressors]]** to control the elements of [[enhancers]].

- [[repressor|Repressors]] can inhibits gene expression in different ways.
	- Some bind directly to [[control elements|control element]] DNA, **blocking activator binding**
	- Others **interfere with the activator itself** so it can't bind to the DNA
- Some [[repressor|repressors]] and [[activator|activators]] **indirectly affect chromatin structure**
	- The recruitment of *chromatin-modifying proteins* seems to be the **most common mechanism of repression** in eukaryotic cells
### Combinatorial Control of Gene Activation
- In [[Eukaryotes|eukaryotes]], the *precise control of [[Transcription|transcription]]* depends largely on the **binding of [[activator|activators]] to DNA [[control elements]]**
- Each *combination of [[control elements]]* can **activate [[Transcription|transcription]]** only when the appropriate [[Transcription|transcription]] [[activator|activators]] are present, which *may occur at a precise time during development or in a particular cell type*.

## Coordinately Controlled Genes in Eukaryotes
- *Eukaryotic genes that are co-expressed*, are typically **scattered over different chromosomes**, unlike bacteria
- ==Coordinate gene expression== depends on every gene of a *dispersed group* having a **specific combination of [[control elements]]**
- Happens in response to **external chemical signals** and contact via the receptors on the membrane.
## Nuclear Architecture and Gene Expression
![[Pasted image 20211208034442.png]]
- *Territory of each chromosome* is **divided into regions of chromatin loops**, within which [[Chromatin|chromatin]] sites associate mainly with each other
- Loops of [[Chromatin|chromatin]] extend from **individual chromosomal territories into specific sites in the nucleus**
- Different loops congregate in some sites making ==transcription factories==
## Mechanisms of Post-transcriptional Regulation
### RNA Processing
- [[RNA processing]] in the nucleus and *export of mature RNA to the cytoplasm* provide **opportunities for regulating gene expression not available in [[prokaryotes|prokaryotes]]**
- One example of regulation at the RNA-processing level is [[alternative RNA splicing]]

### Initiation of Translation and mRNA Degradation
- [[Translation]] is regulated during [[Initiation|initiation]]
- The ==untranslated region (UTR)== can have *regulatory proteins bound to it at specific sequences*, preventing the **attachment of [[Ribosomes|ribosomes]]**
- Sometimes, [[Translation|translation]] of *all the mRNAs in a cell* may be **regulated simultaneously**.
	- this involves the *activation or inactivation* of one or more protein factors **required to initiate translation**.
- The life span of [[mRNA]] in the [[Cytoplasm|cytoplasm]] is important in **determining the pattern of protein synthesis in a cell**
	- *Survive short time* in ==bacteria== due to **constant change in protein synthesis patterns**
	- *Survive long time* in [[Eukaryotes|eukaroyotes]] due to [[Nucleotides|nucleotide sequences]]  found **untranslated in the 3' end of [[mRNA]]**
### Protein Processing and Degradation
- *The final opportunities for controlling gene expression* occur after [[Translation|translation]]
- The *length of time each protein functions in the cell* is strictly regulated by **selective degradation**
	- **Ubiquitin** is attached to the proteins by molecule to signal to kill it
