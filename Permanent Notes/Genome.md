# Genome
---
This is the *genetic information* of a cell.

Our **genetic endowment** ([[Genome|genome]]) consists of the [[Genes|genes]] and other [[DNA]] that make up the [[Chromosomes|chromosomes]] we inherited from our parents.

## Prokaryotic vs Eukaryotic Genomes
- [[prokaryotes | Prokaryotic]] genomes are often just a *single DNA molecule*.
- [[Eukaryotes | Eukaryotic]] genomes usually consist of *multiple DNA molecules*
	- The length of DNA in a [[Eukaryotes | eukaryotic]] cell is **enormous**!
