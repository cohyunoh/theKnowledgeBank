## What is the mechanism of a Radical Chain Reaction

- *Initiation step* produces **two radicals**

---
![[Pasted image 20211116173701.png]]
- The *propagation step* has the **same number of radicals** in the *reactants and products*.
- You could also cross out the **intermediates**
- It takes $Cl$ from the $Cl_2$ molecule to keep the reaction going, hence *chain*.

- The *termination step* gets rid of all radicals
## Radical Chain Reaction Product Yields
![[Pasted image 20211116174424.png]]
- Purely statistical based on the *number of hydrogens*:
	- For the first product it would have a yield of **25%**
		- 2 / 8 hydrogens in the middle for it to replace
	- For the second product it would have a yield of **75%**
		- 6 / 8 hydrogens on the ends for it to replace
- In reality
	- For the first product it would have a yield of **55%**
	- For the second product it would have a yield of **45%**
- This weird occurrence can also be seen below:
	- ![[Pasted image 20211116175904.png]]
- Why is this?
	- This is due to [[Bond Energies|bond energies]].
	- ![[Pasted image 20211116180028.png]]
	- A reaction is considered favorable if the [[Bond Energies|disassociation energy]] of one of the **C-H** bonds (*based on substitution*) is greater than the [[Bond Energies|bond energy]] of the **H-Cl** bond.
	- [[Thermodynamics]] favors the *tertiary over primary* by **-26 kJ/mol**.
## Correcting for Frequency
![[Pasted image 20211116180427.png]]
- Adjust for the number of hydrogens available for each position
- Shows reactivity in terms of ratios
	- Despite the percentage for a *tertiary halogenation being lower than a primary,* it's frequency is way higher than expected so it means that the **single C-H bond** attached originally is ==really reactive==.

- $K_{eq} = 10^{-26/5.7}$
	- Remember the magic number of **5.7**

- Shows the data 
- Clearly the radical at the tertiary carbon has less of an [[Activate Energy|activation energy]] and is therefore **more reactive**.
- The *energy difference between the two final radical states* shown above is **-26kJ/mol**, therefore the reaction is [[Exothermic Products|exothermic]].
---
- What actually determines the relative rates is the difference in energy between the *transition states*.

- This is where **5.3** truly comes from

## Bromination
![[Pasted image 20211116181721.png]]
- Different statistics
- Almost all the *products go tertiary*
- This is an **endothermic reaction**
![[Pasted image 20211116220550.png]]
## Summary
- **Radical formation** by *chlorination* is **exothermic** and *not very selective* (5.3 tertiary / primary) ΔΔG‡ is a lot smaller than ΔΔG°
- **Radical formation** by *bromination* is **endothermic** and *very selective* (>890 tertiary / primary) ΔΔG‡ is only a little smaller than ΔΔG°
## Hammond Postulate
- The **transition state** in an *exothermic reaction* will look more like the ==reactants==.
- The **transition state** in an *endothermic reaction* will look more like the ==products==.
- If *transition state* looks more like **products**, it will be ==more selective==.
