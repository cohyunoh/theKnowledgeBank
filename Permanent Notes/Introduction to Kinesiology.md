# Introduction to Kinesiology
___
## What is Kinesiology
- In the previous sections we learned about the anatomy of human bones, joints, muscles and some related components of the nervous system
	- We learned how these components work together to elicit movements
- ==Kinesiology== is concerned with *breaking down motor movements*, *determining the nature of each movement* and *identifying the appropriate* **mechanical and an anatomical principles** associated with the movement.
- Typical questions that kinesiologist ask are:
	1. What joints are involved in the movement and how are they involved?
	2. What muscles are responsible for the joint movement?
	3. What anatomical principles contribute to maximal efficiency of the movement?
	4. How is injury avoided?
## Erect Posture
- The human body does not have one single posture because we are a multisegmented organism
	- Characteristic patterns are however apparent
- Erect posture has many issues related to stability
	- This is not a static position (the center gravity is not stationary)
	- The
