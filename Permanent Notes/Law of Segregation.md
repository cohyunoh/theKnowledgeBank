# The Law of Segregation
---
- People *used to treat* **heredity** like ==mixing yellow and blue to make green==, predicting that a **freely mating population** will *give rise to a* ==uniform population of individuals==.
	- This was not true.
- [[The Mendel Experiment|Mendel's experiment]] with **the purple and white flowers** as the [[P Generation|P generation]] and then *cross-pollinating them* resulted in a [[F1 Generation|F1 generation]] with *only purple flowers*.
	- What happened to the white color?
- The **white flowers** reappeared in the [[F2 Generation|F2 generation]] when he allowed the [[F1 Generation|F1 generation]] to *self-/cross-pollinate*.
	- The **white color** [[Trait (Biology)|trait]] *skipped a generation*.
- In the [[F2 Generation]], a *lot more of the plants* were **purple colored** than **white colored**.
	- **Purple Flower Color** is the [[Trait (Biology)#^3e2061|dominant trait]].
	- **White Flower Color** is the [[Trait (Biology)#^cc96c8|recessive trait]].
