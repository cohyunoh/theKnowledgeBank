# Nuclear Envelope
---

Encases the [[Nucleus|nucleus]].

It is a **double membrane** that is *perforated by pore structures*.

The pores are lined by a **pore complex** and a play an important role in *regulating the entry and exit of proteins and RNAs.*

The *nuclear side of the envelope* is lined by a [[Nuclear Lamina|nuclear lamina]] and maybe a [[Nuclear Matrix|nuclear matrix]].

The [[Nuclear Lamina|nuclear lamina]] and the [[Nuclear Matrix|nuclear matrix]] may help *organize the genetic material* so it functions efficiently.
