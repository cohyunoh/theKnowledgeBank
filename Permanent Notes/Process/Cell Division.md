# Cell Division
---
The *continuity of life* is based on the **reproduction** of cells, or **cell division**.
## Key Roles of Cell Division
- When a [[prokaryotes | prokaryotic]] cell divides, it is actually reproducing as the process gives us a new organism (another cell).
	- Same for **unicellular** [[Eukaryotes|eukaryotes]]
- But in **multicellular** eukaryotes, cell division allows for them to develop from a *fertilized egg*.
- Plays key role in *renewal and repair* in fully grown multicellular eukaryotes ([[Habit Tracker | STOP PICK YOUR SCABS]]).
## The Complexity
- In both [[prokaryotes]] and [[Eukaryotes]], cell division requires the important process of *distributing identical genetic material* to two **daughter cells**.
