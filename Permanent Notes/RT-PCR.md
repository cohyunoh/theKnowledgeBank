# Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)
---
- A technique for **determining expression of a particular gene**. 
- It uses [[reverse transcriptase]] and [[DNA Polymerases|DNA polymerase]] to **synthesize [[cDNA]] from all the mRNA in a sample** and then subjects the [[cDNA]] to *PCR amplification using primers specific for the gene of interest*.
