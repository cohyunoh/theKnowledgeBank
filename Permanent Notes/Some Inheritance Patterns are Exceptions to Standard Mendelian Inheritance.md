# Some Inheritance Patterns are Exceptions to Standard Mendelian Inheritance
## Genomic Imprinting
- Geneticists have identified a number of [[Trait (Biology)|traits]] in **placental mammals and some flowering plants** that *depend on which parent passed along the alleles for those traits*.
- This is called [[Genomic Imprinting|genomic imprinting]].
- This occurs during **gamete formation** and results in *the silencing of a particular allele of certain genes*.

- **A genomic imprint** can *activate* an [[Alleles|allele]] in one [[Gametes|gamete]] while *silencing* it in another.
## Inheritance of Organelle Genes
- The **inheritance of traits** controlled by the [[Genes|genes]] present in **mitochondria and plastids** *depends solely on the maternal parent because the zygoteâ€™s cytoplasm containing these organelles comes from the egg*. 
- Some diseases affecting the **nervous and muscular systems** are caused by *defects in mitochondrial genes that prevent cells from making enough ATP*.
