# Telomeres
---
The **tandemly repetitive DNA** at the end of a [[Eukaryotes|eukaryotic chromosome’s DNA molecule]]. ==Telomeres== protect the organism’s genes from being eroded during successive rounds of replication
## More info
- Have two protective functions
	1. Specific **telomeric proteins** prevent the staggered ends of the daughter molecule from *activating the cell’s systems for monitoring DNA damage*.
	2. **Telomeric DNA** acts as a kind of buffer zone that *provides some protection against the organism’s genes shortening*.
