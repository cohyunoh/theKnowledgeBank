# Transformation
---
1. The process by which **a cell in culture** *acquires the ability to divide indefinitely*, similar to the ==division of cancer cells==.
2. A **change in genotype and phenotype** due to the *assimilation of external DNA by a cell*. When the *external DNA is from a member of a different species*, transformation results in ==horizontal gene transfer==.
