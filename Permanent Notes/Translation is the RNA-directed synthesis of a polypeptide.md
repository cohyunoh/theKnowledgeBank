# Translation is the RNA-directed synthesis of a polypeptide
---
- A cell **translates an mRNA message into protein** using [[tRNA|transfer RNAs (tRNAs)]]. 
- A [[tRNA]] bears a *specific amino acid* at one end of its three-dimensional structure, while at the other end is a *nucleotide triplet* that can **base-pair with the complementary codon** on [[mRNA]]
	- This is how [[tRNA]] takes in an [[mRNA]] and **creates a specific amino acid sequence**

**Structure of tRNA**

- [tRNA] molecule consists of a *single RNA strand* that is only 80 [[Nucleotides|nucleotides]] long
- The presence of *complementary stretches of nucleotide bases* that can ==hydrogen-bond to each other== allows this **single strand to fold back on itself and form a molecule with a particular 3-D structure**.
- In 2D it looks like a clover, in 3D it looks like an L
- The *protruding 3′ end* of the L shape acts as the **attachment site for an amino acid.**
- The *loop extending from the other end* of the L includes the [[Anticodon|anticodon]]

---
- *After being bound to a specific amino acid* by an [[aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase]], a [[tRNA]] **lines up via its [[Anticodon|anticodon]] at the complementary codon on [[mRNA]]**. 
	- This is the first instance of **molecular recognition** in [[Translation|translation]]
- The second instance is the **pairing of [[tRNA]] [[Anticodon|anticodon]] with the appropriate [[mRNA]] [[Codons|codon]]**
	- The rules for base pairing between *the third nucleotide base of a codon and the corresponding base of a tRNA anticodon* are **relaxed compared to those at other codon positions**.
	- This allows for there being less tRNAs than expected to create all of the corresponding mRNA codons.
	- This flexibility is called [[Wobble|wobble]]
		- [[Wobble]] explains why the *synonymous codons for a given amino acid* most often **differ in their third nucleotide base**.
- A [[Ribosomes|ribosome]], *made up of [[rRNA|ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs)]] and proteins*, **facilitates this coupling with binding sites for [[mRNA]] and [[tRNA]]**.
---
- ==[[Ribosomes]] coordinate the three stages of [[Translation|translation]]==: [[Initiation]], [[Elongation]], and [[Termination]]. 
	- All three require **protein “factors”** that aid in the translation process.
	- Some steps of [[Initiation]] and [[Elongation]] also *require energy*, provided by the hydrolysis of **guanosine triphosphate (GTP)**.
- The formation of [[Peptide Bonds|peptide bonds]] between [[Amino Acids|amino acids]] is **catalyzed by [[rRNA]]s** as *[[tRNA]]s move through the [[A sites|A]] and [[P sites]] and exit through the [[E site]]*.
---
- After [[Translation|translation]], during *protein processing*, **proteins may be modified by [[Cleavage|cleavage]] or by attachment of** *sugars*, *lipids*, *phosphates*, or *other chemical groups*.
---
- *Free ribosomes in the cytosol* **initiate synthesis of all proteins**, but proteins with a [[Signal Peptide|signal peptide]] are **synthesized on the [[Endoplasmic Reticulum|ER]]**.
	- The [[Signal Peptide|signal peptide]] is is recognized as it emerges from the [[Ribosomes|ribosome]] by a **protein-RNA complex** called a [[signal-recognition particle (SRP)]]

---
- A [[Genes|gene]] **can be [[Transcription|transcribed]] by multiple RNA polymerases simultaneously**. 
- Also, a *single [[mRNA]] molecule* can be **[[Translation|translated]] simultaneously by a number of [[Ribosomes|ribosomes]]**, forming a [[Polyribosomes|polyribosome]]. 
- In bacteria, these processes are coupled, but in eukaryotes they are separated in space and time by the nuclear membrane.
