- *Breakdown of proteins* that are responsible for **sister chromatid cohesion** along the chromatid arms allows [[Homologs|homologs]] *to separate*.
- The [[Homologs|homologs]] move *toward opposite poles*, guided by the [[Mitotic Spindle|spinlde apparatus]].
- **Sister chromatid cohesion** persists at the [[Centromeres|centromere]], causing the *two chromatids of each chromosome* to move as a unit towards the **same pole**.
