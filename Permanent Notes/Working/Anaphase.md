# Anaphase
---
The *fourth stage* of [[Mitosis|mitosis]] where the [[Sister Chromatids|chromatids]] of each [[Chromosomes|chromosome]] have **separated** and the **daughter chromosomes** are moving to the *poles of the cell*.

This is the *shortest phase of mitosis*.

Begins with the **cleaving** of *cohesin proteins* 

Cell **elongates** due to the *lengthening of nonkinetochore microtubules*.

By the end, both **poles of cell** have identical **collections of chromosomes**.
