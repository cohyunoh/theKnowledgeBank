This is a *twenty carbon* [[Carboxylic Acid|carboxylic acid]] which is converted in *all humans and animals* into **[[Prostaglandins|prostaglandins]]**.

This image is great at showing what [[Radicals (Organic Chemistry)|radicals]] are **stable**, what makes them more stable (*more substituted*, *more [[Aromaticity|aromaticity]]*).

The top diagram with the arrows shows what a greater [[Gibbs Free Energy|Î”G]] means when forming [[Radicals (Organic Chemistry)|radicals]] in the [[Radical Chain Reactions|initiation step]] or when it **reverses** and the radicals combine to form a *normal compound* ([[Radical Chain Reactions|Terminal Step]]).

## The Biochemical Pathway for the Preparation of the Prostaglandin

[[Cyclooxygenase| Cyclooxygenase (COX)]] is an [[Enzymes|enzyme]] that is responsible for the *formation of important biological mediators* that include **[[Prostaglandins]]**, **[[prostacyclin]]**, and **[[thromboxane]]**.

## The Mechanism
### Step 1:
![[Pasted image 20211104213315.png]]
**Redraw the molecule** like we do for our [[Pericyclic Reactions | pericyclic reactions]]
### Step 2:
![[Pasted image 20211104213513.png]]
**The COX comes in and removes a hydrogen** from the [[Arachindonic Acid|arachindonic acid molecule]]
- Note: This is a radical reaction so **USE FISH HOOKS**
### Step 3:
![[Pasted image 20211104213813.png]]
**Utilize the aromaticity** and move the position of the radical
### Step 4:
![[Pasted image 20211104214809.png]]
**React with [[Oxygen|nature's most common everyday radical]]**
### Step 5:

^3e9377

**React again with $O_2$**
### Epilogue
After [[Arachindonic Acid#^3e9377|Step 5]], we are left with a compound that can be *further reacted with other enzymes* to get [[Prostaglandins|prostaglandins]].
