# Binary Fission
---
A method of **asexual reproduction** in single-celled organisms in which the *cell grows to roughly double its size* and then *divides into two cells*. 

In [[prokaryotes|prokaryotes]], **binary fission** *does not involve mitosis*, but in [[Eukaryotes|single-celled eukaryotes]] that undergo **binary fission**, *mitosis is part of the process*.
