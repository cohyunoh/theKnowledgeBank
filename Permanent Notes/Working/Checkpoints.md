A **control point** in the [[Cell Cycle|cell cycle]] where *stop and go-ahead signals* can regulate the cycle.

There are *three important checkpoints* in the cell cycle:
- $G_1$ Checkpoint ([[G1 Checkpoint|Expand]])
- $G_2$ Checkpoint([[G2 Checkpoint|Expand]])
- $M$ Checkpoint ([[M Checkpoint|Expand]])
