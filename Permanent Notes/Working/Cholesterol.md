## The Biosynthesis of Cholesterol

- We use two **FPPs** for this biosynthesis

- Combined head to head
- There is a problem:
	- ![[Pasted image 20211128212001.png]]
	- These are **two partial positive** heads
	- So how is this done?
		- *REDUCE ONE OF THEM*

---
![[Pasted image 20211128212153.png]]
- We use our good **NADPH**

---

- Base is present here

---

- This rearrangement happens because if OPP just leaves *it creates a primary carbocation*, while the rearrangement creates a **tertiary carbocation**, which is ==more stable==

---

- Again we form another **tertiary carbocation**
- NADPH is used again to reduce
- This is a **squalene**, which is needed to make **cholesterol**

- Epoxide formed from enzyme

---
![[Pasted image 20211128212817.png]]
- Enzyme will break epoxide
- Carbocation will be on tertiary carbon
	- ![[Pasted image 20211128212908.png]]
		- This also forms a six-membered ring

- Beautiful isn't it

- Stereochemistry very important

---
![[Pasted image 20211128213118.png]]
- Hydride shift does not happen and instead a base attacks
