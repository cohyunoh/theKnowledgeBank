# Cloned organisms and stem cells are useful for basic research and other applications
---
## Introduction
- Scientists have been *developing and refining* methods for **cloning whole multicellular organisms from** ==single cells==
	- This means that ==cloning== produces *one or more organisms that are genetically identical* to the **"parent" that donated the single cell**
- The current interest in ==organismal cloning== is primarily due to **its ability to generate [[stem cell]]s**
	- [[stem cell|Stem cells]] have *great potential* in **regenerating damaged tissues**
## Cloning Plants: Single-cell Cultures
- The ==successful cloning of plants== from **single differentiated cells** was accomplished at *Cornell University during the 1950s by F.C. Steward and his students*
	- Done with carrot plants
	- Found that ==differentiated cells== taken from the root and ==incubated== in *culture medium* could **grow into normal adult plants, each genetically identical to the parent**
	- This showed that ==differentiation== *did not involve* **permanent changes to [[DNA]]**
- In plants, *mature cells* can ==dediiferentiate== and then **give rise to all the specialized cell types of the organism**, which classifies the cells as [[totipotent]]
- This is used extensively in ==agriculture==
## Cloning Animals: Nuclear Transplantation
### Introduction
- ==Differentiated cells== from animals generally **do not divide in culture**, much less **develop into the multiple cell types of a new organism**
	- Needed a *new approach* to see if ==differentiated animal cells== are [[totipotent]]
- ==Nuclear transplantation== was used to **replace the nucleus of an egg with the nucleus of a differentiated cell**
	- If the [[Nucleus|nucleus]] of the differentiated cell *retains its full genetic potential*, then it should be able to **direct development of the recipient cell into all the tissues and organs of an organism**
- It worked but a new relationship was found
	- ==The older the donor nucleus, the lower percentage of normal development==
- Experiment done with tadpoles by ==John Gurdon==:
	- ![[Pasted image 20211212160454.png]]
	- Concluded that *something in the nucleus* ==does change== as **animal cells differentiate**
### Reproductive Cloning of Mammals
- ==Cloning of mammals== via **using early embryonic cells as a source of donor nuclei** was also discovered
- ==Dolly==, *a lamb cloned from an adult sheep*, was cloned by **nuclear transfer from a differentiated mammary gland cell**
	- The early embryos that resulted were implanted in surrogate mothers
	- Out of several hundred embryos, only one successfully developed
	- Nevertheless, Dolly would develop premature arthritis, and complications from lung disease leading to her euthanization
- The ==death of Dolly== led to talk about how her death **reflects incomplete reprogramming of the original transplanted nucleus**
	- As more experiments have been done, it seems more that Dolly was just a one off occurrence, as in many others succeeded
### Epigenetic Differences in Cloned Animals
- Scientists assert that even *cloned animals* that ==appear normal== are likely to have **subtle defects**
- The reasons would be that in the *nuclei of fully differentiated cells*, a ==small subset  of genes== is **turned on and expression of the rest of the genes is repressed**
	- This *regulation* often is the result of ==epigenetic changes== in [[Chromatin|chromatin]]
		- [[Histone Acetylation]]
		- [[DNA Methylation]]
## Stem Cells of Animals
- One of the main reasons for ==human cloning== is *not only for reproduction*, but for **the production of [[stem cell]]s to treat human diseases**

### Embryonic and Adult Stem Cells
- Many ==early animal embryos== contain [[stem cell]]s **capable of giving rise to differentiated cells of any type**
- [[stem cellStem cells]] can be *isolated from early embryos* at a stage called the ==blastula stage== or its human equivalent, the ==blastocyte stage==.
- ==Embryonic stem (ES) cells== *reproduce indefinitely* and can be **differentiated into a wide variety of specialized cells**
- ![[Pasted image 20211212165122.png]]
- The ==adult body== also has [[stem cell]]s, which serve to **replace nonreproducing specialized cells as needed**
	- They are ==not== able to **give rise to all cell types in an organism**, ==BUT== can give rise to *several defined types*
- This has ==medical applications==:
	- Main goal is to **supply cells for the repair of damaged or diseased organs**
	- This is *limited* for adult [[stem cell]]s due to their limited selection of tissues
	- ==ES cells== holds more promise since they are [[pluripotent]]
- ==Therapeutic cloning== is when the *goal of cloning* is to **treat disease**
### Induced Pluripotent Stem (iPS) Cells
- Researchers in 2007 learned how to **turn back the clock in fully differentiated cells**, ==reprogramming them to act like ES cells==
- This is done by a [[retroviruses|retrovirus]]
- The *deprogrammed* cells are known as ==induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells== as [[pluripotent|pluripotency]] is **restored**
- There are some *differences* between ==ES cells and iPS cells== which is in their [[Gene Expression|gene expression]] and **other cellular functions like [[Cell Division|cell division]]**
- Two major potentials for ==iPS cells==:
	- *Cells from patients with diseases* have been *reprogrammed* to become ==iPS cells==, which **act as model cells for studying the disease and potential treatments**
	- In the field of ==regenerative medicine==, a patientâ€™s own cells could be *reprogrammed into iPS cells* and then used to **replace nonfunctional tissues** 
		- Such as cells of the retina of the eye that have been damaged by a condition called age-related macular degeneration (AMD)
