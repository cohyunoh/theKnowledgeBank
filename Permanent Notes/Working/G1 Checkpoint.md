# $G_1$ Checkpoint
---
Happens towards the end of [[G1 Phase]] and is considered to be the *most important*.

It checks if the **environment is favorable**.
- Is cell division necessary?
- Are [[Growth Factors|growth factors]] present?
- Is the cell large enough?
- Are sufficient nutrients present?

If it gives the *go-ahead*, then the cell continues to [[S Phase]] and so on.

If it stops the cell, then the *cell may exit the cycle*, switching into a *nondividing state* called the **$G_0$ Phase**.

Most of the body's cells are in **$G_0$ Phase**.
