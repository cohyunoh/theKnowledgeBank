# Joints and Lubrication of Joints
___
## What are Joints and Why are they Needed
- As we have learned the skeletal system has a lot of important tasks, however, movement can only occur at joints (or articulations)
- Joints are the locations where two (or more) bones meet
	- Remember that bones are relatively inflexible
- The structure of the joint determines the type and amount of movement that may take place
	- The need for mobility at a join is balanced by the strength of the joint
- Strong joints are typically inflexible - the joints between the vertebrae
- Highly mobile joints tend to be weak -  the shoulder joint
## Joint Categories
1. ==Synarthrosis:== immovable joint, typically fibrous or cartilaginous, bones may fuse over time
2. ==Amohiarthrosis:== slightly movable joint, can be fibrous or cartilaginous
3. ==Diarthrosis:== freely movable joint (synovial joint), these joints are sub-divided by range of motions that are allowed

## Intervertebral Joints
- The articulation between the superior and inferior articular processes of adjacent vertebrae are gliding joints that permit small movements
	- Small flexion movements and rotation movements are allowed at these joints
- Vertebrae are separated by small cushions of fibrocartilage termed intervertebral discs
	- The exception to this are the vertebrae that compose the sacrum/coccyx and the joint between the atlas and axis
- Intervertebral discs have an outer layer of collagen frisbees that attach to the vertebrae
- This layer surrounds the ==nucleus pulposus==, which is a *soft gelatinous core* - **shock absorber**
	- Articulations move the nucleus pulposus to allow for a gliding motion
## Ligaments that help form the Intervertebral Joints
- Many ligaments exist that attach all of the vertebrae together; this stabilizes and strengthens the vertebral column
- Anterior Longitudinal Ligaments: connects the anterior surfaces of adjacent vertebral bodies
- Posterior Longitudinal Ligament: parallel to the anterior longitudinal ligament and connects the laminate of adjacent vertebrae
- Ligament flavin: connects the laminate of adjacent vertebrae
- Interspinous ligament: connects the spinous processes of adjacent vertebrae
- Supraspinous ligament: interconnects the tips of the spinous processes from $C_7$ to the sacrum
- Ligament um Nuchae: continuous with the supra spinous ligament but connects $C_7$ ti the skull
## Intervertebral Discs and Herniated Disc

## Articulations of the Axial Skeleton
![[0A8A63B7-BDED-49D0-9016-750AC0AB1C06.jpeg]]
- Mostly no movement in Axial skeleton
## Synovial Joints
- Freely moveable and contain a two-layered joint capsule (articular capsule) that surrounds the joint
	- Contains a fibrous capsule to provide mechanical strength to the capsule
	- Contains a synovial membrane, which is an incomplete layer of epithelial cells to produce synovial fluid
- Under normal conditions bones cannot come into contact with each other in a synovial joint
	- Articular cartilage covers the articulating surfaces
	- This cartilage contains a large portion of water and is composed of many charged proteins (typically hyaluronan)
- Cartilage reduces the coefficient of friction between bones and it holds in place the lubricant; synovial fluid
- Cartilage-cartilage, cartilage-bone, and bone-bone should never come into contact with each other
### Structure of a Synovial Joint

## Synovial Fluid
- ==Synovial fluid== is a **clear highly viscous fluid** that is *similar to interstitial fluid with the addition of proteoglycans and hyalyronan*
	- The amount of synovial fluid is **relatively low in all joints**
- Functions of ==Synovial Fluid==
	1. ==Lubrication==: cartilage is a sponge for synovial fluid; upon compression this fluid is squirted into the joint space and significantly reduces the friction coefficient
	2. ==Nutrient Distribution==: cartilage is a vascular and the synovial fluid brings nutrients and removes wastes from the joint space … it is continually circulated through the joint space
	3. ==Shock Absorption==: synovial fluid cushions joints subjected to compression and due to the high viscosity can dampen sudden high magnitude impacts (e.g. walking)
## Supporting Joint Structures
- ==Meniscus==: pad of fibrocartilage located between opposing bones, may help direct the flow of synovial fluid
- ==Fat pads==: localized mass of adipose tissue that can protect the articular cartilage - packing material that fills space during articulations
- ==Ligamentos==: support, strengthen and reinforce joints (sprain is a tear of the collagen frisbees within a ligament)
- ==Tendons==: not part of the joint, but may limit the motion of the joint as they pass over the joint space
- ==Bursae==: small, fluid filled sacs that contain synovial fluid, they form when tendons/ligaments rub against each other tissues, can act as a shock absorber
## Definitions of Movements Permitted at Joints
-  ==Gliding movements:== two opposing surfaces slide over each other
- ==Angular movements==
	- Flexion: anterior-posterior plane that decreases the angle between bones of the joint
	- Extension: anterior-posterior plane that increases the angle between bones of the joint
	- Abduction: away from the longitudinal axis
	- Addiction: towards the longitudinal axis
	- Circumduction: circular movements about a fixed axis
	- Pronation/Supination: special rotation about the ulna/radius
### Joint Movement Examples

## Classification of Synovial Joints
- ==Gliding Joint:== flattened or slightly curved surfaces that glide across one another, but offer little movement (clavicle and manubrium)
- ==Hinge Joint:== permit angular motion in single plane (knee joint)
- ==Condylar Joint:== ellipsoid joints that have a oval articulation nested within a depressed surfaces, permits biaxial angular motion (wrist joint)
- ==Saddle Joint:== concave bone articulating with a convex bone, permit biaxial angular motion (metacarpal of the thumb and trapezium)
- ==Pivot Joint==: only permits rotation along one direction (atlas‐axis joint)
- ==Ball and Socket Joint==: rounded head of one bone rests within a cup‐like depression of a second bone, permits angular, rotation, circumduction (shoulder and hip)

## Physiological Joint Example

## Shoulder Joint
- The shoulder joint permits the greatest range of motion of any joint and it is also the most frequently dislocated
- The bones of the pectoral girdle provide some stability, because they project over the joint
	- However, it is the skeletal muscles the provide the majority of the stability/strength to the joint

## Hip Joint
- Relatively stable ball and socket joint that permits extension, flexion, addiction, abduction, circumduction and rotation
- The articular capsule of the hip joint is extensive and strong, enclosing both the head and neck of the femur
- Much of the strength and stability is provided by the surrounding muscles, which are typically much more extensive than the shoulder joint
- Also the pelvic girdle more completely encloses the femoral head than the pectoral girdle for the humeral head
- Many ligaments also wrap the hip joint

## Elbow Joint
- This is a complex hinge joint, involving the articulation of three bones
- The strongest of these interactions is the humeroulnar joint
- Tge humeroradial joint is a much smaller joint that helps to support the main joint
- This joint is very stable because the humerus interlocks with ulna, a thick capsule surrounds the entire joint and there is extensive ligaments that wrap around the joint
## Knee Joint
- Probably the most complicated of all joints in the body
- Functions as a hinge joint
- The joint is not stable and the contact points are always changing (allows flexion, extension and minimal rotation)
- Three articulations exist at the knee:
	- Femur - Tibia(medial condyle)
	- Femur - Tibia (lateral condyle)
	- Patella - Femur
- The articular capsule of the knee is thin and not complete, however extensive ligaments (seven in total) and tendons help to strengthen the joint
	- ACL (anterior cruciales ligament) is a part of the knee joint
