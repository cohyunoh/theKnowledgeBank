# Linked Genes Tend to be Inherited Together because they are Located Near Each Other on the Same Chromosome
---
- The **number of genes** in a cell is *far greater* than the **number of chromosomes**
	- Each chromosome, except Y, have **thousands of genes**.
- [[Genes]] *located near each other on the same chromosome* tend to be **inherited together** in genetic crosses.
	- These [[Genes|genes]] are called [[Linked Genes|linked genes]].
## How Linkage Affects Inheritance
- Another Morgan experiment having to do with **body color and wing size**.
	- Each [[Character (Biology)|character]] had two [[Phenotypes|phenotypes]].
	- [[Wild Type|Wild-type]] flies have **gray bodies and normal-sized wings**.
	- Morgan was able to breed **doubly mutant flies** with *black bodies and much smaller than normal wings, called vestigial wings*.
	- The **mutant alleles** are *recessive to the wild-type alleles*, and neither [[Genes|gene]] is on a [[Sex chromosomes|sex chromosome]].
	- The first was a **P generation cross** to *generate $F_1$ dihybrid flies*, and the second was essentially a [[The Test Cross|testcross]].

- The resulting flies had a *much higher proportion* of the combination of [[Trait (Biology)|traits]] seen in the **P generation flies** than would be expected if the **two genes** [[Law of Independent Assortment|assorted independently]].
	- Morgan thus concluded that **body color and wing size** are usually *inherited together in specific (parental) combinations* because the **genes are linked**.
	- ![[Pasted image 20211113205755.png]]
- Nevertheless, Morgan experiment did show the **combination of traits** not seen in the P generation (**nonparental phenotypes**) suggesting that the *body color and wing size alleles are not always linked genetically*.
	- [[Genetic Recombination]]
## Genetic Recombination and Linkage
### Recombination of Unlinked Genes: Independent Assortment of Chromosomes
- ![[Pasted image 20211113210307.png]]
- Notice in this [[Punnett Square|Punnett square]] that **one-half of the offspring** are expected to be [[Parental Types|parental types]].
- [[Recombinants]] can also be seen.
- Picture above shows **50% frequency of recombination**.
	- This is observed for *any two genes that are located on different chromosomes and thus cannot be linked*.
### Recombination of Linked Genes: Crossing Over
- From the body color and wing experiment, it had a **17% frequency of recombination**.
	- Morgan proposed that **some process** must *occasionally break the physical connection* between **specific alleles on the same chromosome**.
	- This process is called [[Crossing Over|crossing over]].
## New Combinations of Alleles: Variation for Natural Selection
- The **physical behavior** of [[Chromosomes|chromosomes]] during [[Meiosis|meiosis]] contributes to the *genetic variation in offspring*. 
- Each pair of [[Homologs|homologs]] lines up independently of other pairs during [[Metaphase I|metaphase I]] and **crossing over** prior to that, during [[Prophase I|prophase I]], can *mix and match parts of maternal and paternal homologs*.
- Mendel's experiments show that the **behavior of genes** also leads to *variation in offspring*.
- Combining these two together shows that the [[Recombinants|recombinant chromosomes]] resulting from **crossing over** may bring [[Alleles|alleles]] together in *new combinations*.
## Mapping the Distance Between Genes Using Recombination Data: *Scientific Inquiry*
- The **discovery of linked genes** and **recombination due to crossing over** motivated one of Morganâ€™s students, **Alfred H. Sturtevant**, to work out a method for constructing a [[Genetic Map|genetic map]], *an ordered list of the genetic loci along a particular chromosome*.
- The *recombination frequency* depends on the **distance between the genes on a chromosome**.
	- Sturtevant predicted that *the further apart the two genes are, the higher probability that a crossover will occur between them and therefore the higher the recombination frequency*.
	- Reasoning: the **greater the distance** between the two [[Genes|genes]], the **more points** there are between them where *crossing over can occur*.
- A genetic map based on **recombination frequencies** is called a [[Linkage Map|linkage map]].
	- Sturtevant expressed the distances between genes in [[Map Units|map units]].
- The maximum **recombination frequency** is *50%* as this value is *indistinguishable from genes on different chromosomes*.
	- Despite being on the same chromosome, they [[Law of Independent Assortment|assort independently]].
