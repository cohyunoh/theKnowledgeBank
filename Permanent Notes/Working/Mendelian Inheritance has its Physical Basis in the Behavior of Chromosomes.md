# Mendelian Inheritance has its Physical Basis in the Behavior of Chromosomes
---
- When the processes of [[Mitosis|mitosis]] and [[Meiosis|meiosis]] were worked out, biologists saw *parallels between* the **behavior of Mendel's proposed factors** ([[Genes|genes]]) during **sexual life cycles** and the **behavior of** [[Chromosomes|chromosomes]].
	- [[Chromosomes]] and [[Genes|genes]] are **both present in pairs** in [[Diploid Cells|diploid cells]], and [[Homologs|homologs]] *separate* and [[Alleles|alleles]] *segregate* during the process of [[Meiosis|meiosis]].
	- After [[Meiosis|meiosis]], [[Fertilization|fertilization]] *restores the paired condition* for both **chromosomes and genes**.
- Around 1902, **Walter S. Sutton**, **Theodore Boveri**, and others *independently noted these parallels* and began to develop the [[Chromosome Theory of Inheritance|chromosome theory of inheritance]].
	- According to this theory, **Mendelian genes** have specific [[Locus|loci]] along [[Chromosomes|chromosomes]], and it is the chromosomes that *undergo segregation and* [[Law of Independent Assortment|independent assortment]].
## Morgan's Choice of Experimental Organism
- Mendel used peas, **Morgan used fruit flies**.
- **Fruit flies** are *prolific breeders*:
	- A **single mating** will *produce hundreds of offspring*.
	- A **new generation** can be bred*every two weeks*.
- Another **advantage** of fruit flies is that they *only have* **four pairs** *of chromosomes*, which are ==easily distiguinshable with a [[Light Microscopes|light microscope]]==.
	- *Three pairs* of [[Autosomes|autosomes]].
	- *One pair* of [[Sex chromosomes|sex chromosomes]].
- Took Morgan a while as there was *no real way to force breeding*.
	- Finally he got a fly with *white eyes* instead of the usual *red eyes*.
- The [[Phenotypes|phenotype]] for a [[Character (Biology)|character]] *most commonly observed* in **natural populations** called the [[Wild Type|wild type]].
- [[Trait (Biology)|Traits]] that are *alternatives* to the [[Wild Type|wild type]] are called **mutant phenotypes**.

- Some notation:
	- For flies, the **letter chosen** to represent a specific [[Character (Biology)|character]] is based off of the first mutant.
		- Example: White eyes are the mutation, therefore the symbol for the white eye allele is *w*.
		- *+* superscript identifies the [[Wild Type|wild type]].
			- *$w^+$*
	- **Other alleles for diseases** for humans can also *be denoted by more than one letter*:
		- Example: **Huntington's Disease**: *HTT*
## Correlating Behavior of a Gene's Alleles with Behavior of a Chromosome Pair: *Scientific Inquiry*
- Morgan mated his **white-eyed male fly** with a **red-eyed female**.
- All the **$F_1$ offspring** had *red eyes*, proving red eyes to be the [[Wild Type|wild type]] allele is dominant.
- When Morgan bred the **$F_1$ flies** to each t other, he *observed the classical* 3:1 [[Phenotypes|phenoypic]] ratio among the **$F_2$ offspring**.
	- Surprising additional result:
		- The **white-eyed trait** show up *only in males*.
		- All the **$F_2$ females** had *red eyes*, while half the males had *red eyes* and half had *white eyes*.
- Conclusion: somehow the eye color was related to **sex**.
- The *correlation* between the [[Trait (Biology)|trait]] of **white eye color** and the **male sex** of the affected $F_2$ flies suggest that the [[Genes|gene]] involved in his white-eyed mutant was *located exclusively* on the **X chromosome**.
	- For a male, a **single copy** of the **mutant allele** would *white eyes*; since male only has **one X chromosome**, there can be no [[Wild Type|wild-type]] allele ($w^+$) present to *mask the recessive allele*.
	- Females could have white eyes if both her **X chromosomes** carried the recessive allele ($w$).
		- Not possible in $F_2$ generation.

---
- Morgan's Finding of the *correlation* between a **particular trait** and an **individual's sex** provided support for the [[Chromosome Theory of Inheritance|chromosome theory of inheritance]]: namely, that  a *specific gene is carried on a specific chromosome*.
