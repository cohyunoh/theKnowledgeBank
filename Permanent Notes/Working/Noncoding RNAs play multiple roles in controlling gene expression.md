## Effects on mRNAs by MicroRNAs and Small Interfering RNAs
- *Regulation by both small and large ncRNAs* **occurs at several points in the pathway of gene expression**, including [[mRNA]] [[Translation|translation]] and **chromatin modification**.
- In 1993, a number of research studies have uncovered [[miRNA]]s
- The [[miRNA]] *allows the complex of [[Nucleotides|22 nucleotides]]* to **bind to any [[mRNA]] molecule** with at least seven or eight nucleotides of complementary sequence
	- This then **degrades** the [[mRNA]], blocking its [[Translation|Translation]]

### Regulation of gene expression by microRNAs (miRNAs)

- Another  class of **small [[Noncoding|noncoding]] RNAs**, similar in *size and function to [[miRNA]]s*, is called [[siRNA|small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)]].
	- Both [[miRNA]] and [[siRNA]] are *very similar*.
	- What differentiates them is based on **subtle differences in the structure of their precursors**
	- *The blocking of [[Gene Expression|gene expression]]* by [[siRNA]]s is referred to as [[RNAi|RNA interference (RNAi)]]
		- This was evolved probably from a **natural defense against viruses**
## Chromatin Remodeling and Effects on Transcription
- In addition to *regulating mRNAs*, **small noncoding RNAs** can cause *remoduling of [[Chromatin|chromatin]] structure*
- An example of this would be *[[Chromatin|chromatin's]] loosening* in [[S Phase]] and then the *recondensing of [[Chromatin|chromatin]]* into [[Heterochromatin|heterochromatin]] in preparation for [[Mitosis|mitosis]].
	- the [[siRNA]] system **interacts with other larger noncoding RNAs and with chrromatin-modifying enzymes** to *condense the centromere  chromatin into [[Heterochromatin|heterochromatin]]*
- ==Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs)== also **induces formation of [[Heterochromatin|heterochromatin]]**, *blocking expression of some parasitic DNA elements in the [[Genome|genome]]*, known as ==transposons==.
- [[lncRNA|Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)]] are expressed at *significant levels* in specific cell types at particular times.
	- Found to be associated with specific diseases
	- One has been found to be responsible for **X chromosome inactivation**
		- [[lncRNA]]s — *transcripts of the XIST gene located on the chromosome to be inactivated* — **bind back to and coat that chromosome** which leads to the condensation into [[Heterochromatin|heterochromatin]]
