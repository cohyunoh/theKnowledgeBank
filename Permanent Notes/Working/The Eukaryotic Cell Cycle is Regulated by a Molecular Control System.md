# The Eukaryotic Cell Cycle is Regulated by a Molecular Control System
- Signaling molecules in the [[Cytoplasm|cytoplasm]] help regulate *progress through the cell cycle*.
- In the [[Cell Cycle Control System|cell cycle control system]], cyclic changes in **regulatory proteins**([[Cyclins]] | [[Cyclin-Dependent Kinases (Cdks)]]) work like a cell cycle clock. 
	- Proven by [[Do Molecular Signals in the Cytoplasm Regulate the Cell Cycle|experiment]] done by researchers at University of Colorado.
	- At certain points on the clock, the *cell cycle will stop*, based on the cyclic changes, at specific *checkpoints* until they get a signal to go again. 
	- Important checkpoints are in the [[G1 Phase]], [[G2 Phase]], and [[Mitosis|Mitotic Phase]].
	- *Internal and external* signals control the cell cycle checkpoints via signal transduction pathways.
	- Most cells exhibit [[Density-Dependent Inhibition|density-dependent inhibition]] of cell division as well as [[Anchorage Dependence|anchorage dependence]]
- **Cancer cells** *avoid normal cell cycle regulation* and continually [[Transformation(Cell Division)|divide unchecked]], *forming tumors*.
	- [[Malignant Tumors|Malignant tumors]] invade nearby tissues and can undergo [[Metastasis|metastasis]] exporting cancer cells to other places which will form more tumors.
