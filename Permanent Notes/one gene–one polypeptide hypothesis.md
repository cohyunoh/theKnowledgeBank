# one geneâ€“one polypeptide hypothesis
---
- Created by **Beadle and Tatum**
- Studied bread mold (*Neurospora*), which is a [[Haploid Cells|haploid species]].
	- *One set of genes meant that one singular copy of a gene was responsible for a* [[Phenotypes|phenotype]]
	- All that was needed to *learn a gene's function* was to **mutate the Neurospora** and **disable the allele**
- Mutations caused by X-rays
- [[Wild Type]] Neurospora can grow on [[minimal medium]]
	- Beadle and Tatum would *create mutants* that w**ere unable to synthesize one specific nutrient** based on the allele they disabled

- These results, and those of many similar experiments done by **Beadle and Tatum**, suggested that *each class was blocked at a different step in this pathway* because **mutants in that class lacked the enzyme that catalyzes the blocked step**.
